He was aware of that most french people don''t speak english so he ordered a french lesson for one day to learn the necessities when going to a new country. The day for the lesson came, but when he arrived at the school, it seemed quite empty. He went in saw a guy sitting behind a counter. "Hi, I came for the french lesson today" our guy said. "Oh, I''m sorry. The French teacher is ill and will be home for a week." "So there is no one that know any french here?" "No I''m sorry. But I have a little note I can give you. Just show it when you order something, or don''t know what to say, and it should work out fine" "Uhm ok. What does it say?" "I''m sorry, I don''t know, really. The french teacher just told me to give it to people while he was gone." Our guy thought that was fair enough. He didn''t have time to order a new lesson anyway.\n\nThe day for the journey came. With a packed bag he went to the airport and flew all the way to France. He arrived in France in the evening and went out to grab a cab. A cab arrived and after greeting the French cab driver he figured he could use the note and see if the driver would understand what it said. He showed the note. The driver looked at the note, then at our guy, then at the note, and back at the guy, before he cursed in french and drove off. "Well that''s weird. Maybe the note isn''t ment for cab drivers" he thought and walked until he found a bus. He went on the bus and thought he''d give the note another try. The bus driver looked at the note and went red in an instant. He commanded our guy off the bus, and drove away. This annoyed our guy a little. He waited for another bus and did not show the note this time. He said the name of his hotel, the bus driver nodded, he paid and sat down next to a lady. She asked him in french if he was american and he said yes. She seemed to understand a little english, so he thought she could translate the note. He asked if she could and she nodded. He pulled out the note and showed it to her. She read it and quickly shoved it away from her in anger, and she called for the bus driver. Our guy understood what they wanted and stood the rest of the ride in frustration. He finally arrived at his hotel tired of being yelled at and ready to sleep. At the receptions desk he told his name, they wrote something down and asked him for ID. When finding his ID the note accidentally fell out of his pocket and onto the counter. The receptionist read it and as he expected, got really mad. Another guy that worked there came and they talked for a while, before accepting that our guy could sleep there, but they weren''t happy about it. \n"That''s it. I''ve had enough of this, tomorrow I''m going back home!" our guy thought, and so he did.\n\nLuckily this was easier. He did not show the note to anyone and mimed his way back to America. He stayed home for a week before deciding to go back to the french school, now that the teacher was back, and find out what the note said. At the school he met the teacher and asked quite annoyed what the note said. "Let me see" the teacher said putting on his glasses. Our guy handed him the note. At this time two windows were open.

The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the, government. \n\nHillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single parent welfare moms who can only hear cases on Thursday''s between 1:30 and 3pm when there are no talk shows scheduled. \n\nThe ant loses the case. \n\nThe story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant''s food while the government house he''s in, which just happens to be the ant''s old house, crumbles around him since he doesn''t know how to maintain it. \n\nThe ant has disappeared in the snow.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$God says "Satan, you''ve betrayed me before, but I am a just and forgiving god. You may get back into Heaven, if you can beat my only son in a programming contest."\n\nSatan and Jesus meet to agree to the terms. The contest is a simple one. God will set a timer for six hours, and both Jesus and Satan will sit down at their desktops and pound out as much perfectly-formatted HTML as they possibly can. The contest is officially scheduled for Easter Sunday, and news spreads far and wide. \n\nEaster Sunday rolls around. People from all over flock to Heaven to witness the contest. It is broadcasted live on several news stations, and is even live-tweeted by some representatives from Google. At exactly 8:59 AM, Satan and Jesus both sit down at two computers, facing each other. They log in and open up their scripting program. At 9 AM, Archangel Michael drops a flag and the race begins. \n\nOne hour, and several cups of coffee, pass. Both Satan and Jesus are going strong. Satan is adamant that he will beat Jesus and get back into Heaven, while Jesus just really enjoys coding (it''s a hobby of his). The official line count is read off every hour, and at 10 AM, Satan is slightly ahead. \n\nBy 11 AM, Jesus has caught up to Satan, because Satan found an error and had to rewrite several pages of code. He is slightly annoyed, but still determined to beat Jesus. \n\nBy noon, Satan and Jesus have caught up again, as Jesus decided to reformat a large section of his work to make it more streamlined and perfectly formatted, as per the contest rules. Satan is starting to get cocky, showing off to the crowd by typing with his barbed tail, typing with his eyes shut, typing with his trident, et cetera. The crowd oohs and ahhs appropriately. \n\nAt 1 PM, they both stop for some lunch. Satan decides to trick Jesus into taking a longer lunch break, so he gives Jesus five loaves of bread and three fishes. Jesus breaks off pieces to feed himself, but simply cannot finish his meal. With Satan getting ahead of him, he passes off the meal to the group of 5,000 men gathered around him. They are all fed, with leftovers. Jesus continues programming. \n\nBy 2 PM, both Satan and Jesus are getting rather dehydrated, so they stop for a water break. To get even for the loaves and fishes trick earlier, Jesus pours Satan some water, but secretly turns it into wine. If Satan is drunk, his coding can''t be perfectly formatted. \n\n2:59 rolls around. Satan has typed 5,638 lines of code, while Jesus has only typed 5,277. The crowd is tense as they race towards the finish line. Suddenly, God steps in, pulls the plugs on both computers, and loudly announces "JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH WINS! SATAN WILL NOT RE-ENTER HEAVEN!" \n\nSatan is furious. "How can this be?" He asks. "I had far more lines of code than Jesus! My code was perfectly formatted, too!"\n\nJesus taunts Satan. "Well I don''t see your code, Satan. It must have been lost when the computers were shut off."\n\n"Your computer was shut off, too!" Satan retorts. "I guess neither of us win!" \n\nGod, rather proud of his son at this point, walks over and turns back on both computers. Predictably, Satan''s coding cannot be found, but when Jesus''s computer is booted back up, his program is right there on the desktop. God opens it, and it runs like a charm. \n\n"How can this be?" Satan snarls. "I finished more coding! It should be there! I should''ve won this!" \n\n"Satan, my friend," God says, "You have made a grave mistake. See, you may code faster, and perhaps even better than my son, but Jesus... \n\nJesus saves." \n$$, ''5tkdzb'', 385, $$So Satan asks God to let him back into Heaven...$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.\n\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans (look it up) were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can''t-Be-Flushed threshold.\n\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. "Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don''t I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. "How many Indians could there be?" said by General Custer. "Looks like a good day for a drive!" by JFK. "There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\n\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit-molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\n\nUnfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: "It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks."\n\nLater on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\n\nAs if that wasn''t enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn''t just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n\nFriends, DON''T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!$$, ''5tafa6'', 5, $$Friends, DON''T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!$$);

Good man,"\n\n  So Dave was handed reign of all cleaning supplies and tasks. Days 1 and 2 went okay. Dave just about managed to prep the front of shop for the opening, though struggled keeping count of all the bits and bobs in inventory. Day 3 was a struggle. Dave, used to working in leisurely pace found wiping down tables and clearing trash in time quite taxing. More than once he left spray bottles around benches and behind doors. Customers were befuddled and Jim left frustrated at this incompetence.\n\n  Jim stopped Dave on the morning of day 4. Trash was found under tables, counters left too greasy after ineffective wiping, and the supplies were whittled away almost to nothing but a sponge after Dave''s mismanagement.\n\n  "Jim, look I''m really sorry. But I''m getting the hang of this now! Please give me another role if you really don''t me cleaning."\n\n  So Jim complied. The next day Dave turned up at 6.30 am as per instruction.\n\n  "Okay Dave. Fresh start. This job is a bit new and I''m sure you''ll learn from it too. You need to collect the frozen supplies at the store. They''ve been paid for so don''t worry. Just collect everything and race back in good time. If you know what I mean."\n\n  Dave thought he knew exactly what Jim meant. \n\n  "So long as I drive quickly, I can take the rest of the day off!"\n\n  Two hours later on what should have been a 15 minute trip, Dave entered the premises with a dejected expression.\n\n  Ten minutes later Jim also wore the same expression, albeit with a scowl and high blood pressure to match; Dave had struck a streetlamp, mounted the sidewalk and blown out a tire in the process because he thought Jim wanted him to *race* back. With the company car out of service Jim was strained to keep things operational. Dave was becoming a liability.\n\n  To the sheepish priest he said, "Dave. Final chance. I hired you as a favor, not a burden. From tomorrow work in the back with Phil on food. He''ll give you something to do."\n\n  Dave nodded vigorously, "Thank you so much Jim! I swear to it- I won''t be forgetful or careless. You can count on me!"\n\n  "Yeah. Good. Just don''t burn this place down."\n\n  6.30 am, the next day. Dozens of customers filed in and out every few hours, bellies filled, vinegary lips smacked. Jim didn''t see much of Dave. Naturally he was quite nervous. No complaints over the phone for mixed up orders, or hair in the mayo, or dismembered digits in the salad. Maybe he should have put Dave there in the first place. The next day came and went. Another suspiciously uneventful day. Almost too quiet. "Don''t fret too much'', Jim thought to himself later on that Thursday evening. "Phil was happy with Dave''s work and didn''t mention any hiccups."\n\n  A week passed in this way. Jim was in a good mood to say the least. Sales and profit had nearly increased by 500%; customers were actually leaving feedback on their experience for the first time in months; The company car was back from repairs, costs much lower than anticipated; the takeaway was still not destroyed in a fire, and Phil reported no missing items or mishap in the kitchen. Even Dave was in a good mood, starting and leaving his shifts with a smile on his face and lively spring in his step, giving him an almost surreptitious look.  \n\n  It was nearing the end of Dave''s vacation. Jim had just handed the last overtime paycheck to his star employee when he thought to ask something on his mind for a while now, "Dave, top job. You''ve done wonders to help this takeaway get back on its feet again. Everyone loves the food. Heck, even people from the next town over are calling in to order! So between us two men- how on earth do you cook so well? The battered fish is the talk of the town, so are the chicken wings- oh and the chips! They''re so good they make you want to slap your mama! How have you done it!?"\n\n  "It''s nothing, really Jim!"\n\n  "No, no! Please tell! You''re one of us. Even if you''re leaving, you can pop around to help any time you want at double your current wages. But please. How have you done it?"\n\n  "It''s simple, Jim," Dave said as he moved to lean forward, closing the gap between his boss. Involuntarily, an excited croak left Jim''s throat.\n\n  "Oh?" sweat beaded on his forehead.\n\n   "Simple, Jim. I''m just a good friar."$$, ''5tab1w'', 7, $$A Catholic Priest finds a job.$$);

Listen here, ''Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, his rescript reads as thus: In the seventh year of Chenghua, the Ryukyu Kingdom sends their tribute. In reality, however, they sent an old Taoist to test his power against us... "\n\n"All right stop! Don''t read anymore. I don''t understand any of this!?"\n\n"Oh, so I did this for nothing?"\n\n"So let me ask, what''s the first two phrases?"\n\n"Blessed by the Mandate of Heaven the Emperor, His rescript reads as thus?"\n\n"The hell is ''His rescript reads as thus?''"\n\n"If the Emperor speaks, it''s ''his rescript reads as thus''"\n\n"So what would be for me speaking?"\n\n"Uh... I don''t know what would be reading as thus."\n\n"Fine, continue"\n\nThis man however''s already tired of it since he has to read and then explain. He figured he might as well just tell Sun what it means, "So basically the Ryukyu''s are a vassal state that sends tribute and their declaration as our servant every year, but this year they sent an old Taoist, who knows how to do 36 styles of silent debate, and can recite 70 volumes of the ''Diamond Sutra'', he''s coming to to test his power against us Chinese. If we beat him, then they''ll continue their tribute and declaration every year. If we can''t, or nobody takes up the challenge, then they the Ryukyus are now the lords, and we Great Ming are now the vassal states. The Emperor thus sends out a proclamation seeking able people, who knows how to silently debate and recite the Diamond Sutra, to take up the challenge. If they can beat that old Taoist, the Emperor will give them any amounts of money or as high of a court position as possible! But it''s useless for you, you don''t know how to silent debate or recite the Diamond Sutra."\n\nHe just had to go there, because this Sun Delong has a name for being a "jack of all trades". If you say he''s not capable of something, he''s going to get mad, "Stop! How do you know I don''t know how to silent debate, or how to read the Diamond Sutra?"\n\n"Oh? So you can?"\n\n"If I don''t, what do I have this head for?"\n\n"Ah! Then that''s great! Take the proclamation and go challenge the old Taoist!"\n\nSun was walking up to take the proclamation when the other guy thought that he should make absolutely sure, so he asked. "The imperial proclamation says the old Taoist knows 36 styles of silent debate, do you?"\n\n"How many styles?"\n\n"36."\n\n"I know 72."\n\n"Wow! Twice the styles... The old Taoist can recite 70 volumes of the Diamond Sutra."\n\n"And the Diamond Sutra I can recite is endless!"\n\n"Then take the proclamation."\n\n"I can''t reach."\n\n"So what''s that in your hand then?"\n\n"My pig hook."\n\n"So use it to hook the proclamation then."\n\n"Right."\n\nHe hooked the proclamation off the post. The soldiers who were guarding the proclamation saw that a drunk had taken the proclamation, so they took out their rope and tied him up, pushing him to see the official in charge.\n\nThe official in charge is the Imperial Secretary Xie. However, Sun refused to kneel and instead turned his face in disgust, "So what''s your last name?"\n\nMinister Xie was baffled, "So he''s prosecuting me instead the other way around? or what?" He thought. "It''s ''Xie''."\n\n"Minister Xie, do you have common sense?"\n\n"What does that mean?"\n\n"Am I supposed to take the old Taoist''s challenge tied up?"\n\n"Oh? So you''re the sorcerer?"\n\nMinister Xie immediately reprimands the two soldiers. "You reprehensible idiots! How can you bring the sorcerer to me tied up!" He personally unties Sun. There''s only one seat in the office. "Sorcerer, please sit." Of course, it''s supposed to be Minister Xie''s seat, but Sun doesn''t know that, so he sits right away. Not only does he sit, but he also annoyingly says, "Oh, where would you sit then?"\n\nMinister Xie has to reply, "Then I''ll stand."\n\n"So, Minister, where do we find this damned Taoist?"\n\n"He''s living in the Golden Terrace Institute in the Legation Quarter. That being said we must first go meet his majesty."\n\n"What''s a majesty?"\n\n"The Emperor"\n\n"Oh great, long time no see for us bros." Apparently, Sun''s bros with the Emperor.\n\n"So sorcerer, do you want to ride a horse or a litter to the palace?"\n\n"Neither."\n\n"Neither? Then what sorcery will you use?"\n\n"I want to ride an ass."\n\n"Ride an ass? Where do we find one for you?"\n\n"No ass, no go."\n\nMinister Xie was flabbergasted, but he personally went to the Zhangyi Gate to rent a donkey foal so Sun could ride it to the Palace. He had Sun wait in the East Court in the Palace.\n\nMinister Xie reports to the Emperor, and the Emperor was pleased. He orders an immediate audience. However, Minister Xie ponders a bit and decides that he can''t let Sun see the Emperor, because Sun hasn''t practiced the proper protocols in the Ministry of Rites, and he doesn''t know what might come out of Sun''s mouth. If Sun goes up to the Emperor and says something like "Yo bro, long time no see'', then Minister Xie would certainly lose his head. Thus, Minister Xie immediately says, "Your majesty, the sorcerer isn''t a native of Beijing, and just came recently. He also hasn''t practiced the propr protocols in the Ministry of Rites, so I fear he may offend your majesty with his improper behavior. If it were up to me, I would send him to take the challenge first, and have an audience after. If he defeats the old Taoist, then it''s easier to forgive his transgressions in behavior."\n\nThus, the Emperor agrees and sends for the old Taoist in the Golden Terrace Institute, telling him that China has in fact found someone to accept his challenge. The old Taoist orders two 10-meter platforms be built in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, and a table, incense burners, offerings, candelabrum, scroll paper, cinnabar brush, vegetables, grains, and a bowl or rainwater.\n\n"Whatever your sorcerer wants, tell him to prepare himself." The old Taoist says, but Minister Xie ponders and just orders the same things for Sun. The orders were fulfilled quickly. The old Taoist shook his robe, and a dark whirlwind blew, lifting him onto his platform. The officials in court were shocked.\n\nThe emperor sends his edict, "Minister Xie, ask our sorcerer to take the challenge, and also ride the wind or cloud up to the platform." Minister Xie immediately goes to the East Court to find the "sorcerer". He goes in and sees Xun sleeping on the floor. Minister Xie goes up and yells, "Sorcerer! Wake up!"\n\n"Quit disturbing me!"\n\n"Who''s disturbing you! Pull him up."\n\nSun rubs his eyes, and looks around. This is inside the palace, and it''s golden all over.\n\n"Ay! Old Minister! Where the hell is this?"\n\n"In the palace."\n\n"What am I doing here in the palace?"\n\n"What? Did you forget? You''re here to take the old Taoist''s challenge. He''s on the platform waiting for you. The Emperor also moved his throne outside to see you two duel."\n\nSun was terrified, "What?!" He was, of course, completely drunk, and after sleeping for so long he had forgotten pretty much everything. After Minister Xie explains, he starts thinking: I''ve drank too much, and in my drunken stupor I took the imperial proclamation, I''m just a goddamn merchant, how the hell do I know how to duel with old Taoists? Besides, it appears that this guy is from another country, so he must have evil intentions. Now I''ve really done it! He immediately slaps himself in the face four times, "I''m an idiot! an idiot!"\n\nHe kneels down to Minister Xie, "Old minister, I''ve had too much to drink! It was the alcohol! I''m a butcher, please find someone else to duel! I can''t do this at all! If this isn''t enough for you, please slap me some more, and let me go with the wind like a kite!"\n\n"Ah!?"\n\nMinister Xie''s rage boiled over and he shook, his hat quaking. He''s both angry and scared, "Oh? You had too much to drink? You''re right, this is way too much! Can you still feel your head on your neck? Just slap you and let you go? You can say this to me, fine, if I tell the same to the Emperor, then I''ve deceived him and failed the country. Deceiving him might be no big deal, but the country will be in trouble. This old Taoist is already there, what is His Majesty going to say to him? How will the country handle the shame? Neither of us will keep our heads for this. You''re the drunk idiot that pulled the proclamation and tricked the official in charge, I''m the one that failed in office and allowed idiots into the palace, and deceived the Emperor and failed the country. Even if we get our deserved death, what is the Emperor to do? He will lose face, and our China will lose face. The Ryukyu will be lord and Ming will be vassal, and the Empire will be destroyed and our people enslaved!"\n\nSun Delong hears this and also starts to panic, which brought the alcohol back into his bloodstream, so he jumps up.\n\n"Old Minister, it''s fine! If neither of us will live, then it''s easy to deal with. If we''re to die regardless of whether I duel the old Taoist or not, then let''s just duel so at least we''ll die with our wounds in front. Even if we lose our head, it''s just going to be a scab the size of a bowl. Maybe I''m not as good at sorcery as he is, but it''s not certain he can fight as well as me! Let''s go find him."\n\nMinister Xie hears this and wonders, "Does he know how to duel or not?" \n\n"Just go!" Minister Xie, out of options, leads him to the platforms and points to the one in the east, "See? He''s already meditating up there."\n\nSun Delong takes a look and says, "Then I''m going on the other one. If we go on the same one, we''d fight for that territory."\n\n"Just go!"\n\n"How tall is it?"\n\n"Ten meters!"\n\n"Ten meters? Even if it''s 30, that''s no big deal, attendants!."\n\n"What for?"\n\n"Get me a ladder."\n\n"Ladders are a no-go, the Emperor has already ordered that you ride the wind or clouds, because the old Taoist took the wind up."\n\nThe old Taoist, in fact, did not ride the wind. It''s a trick. Inside his sleeve is an iron cylinder with wolf manure, charcoal, and Mayflower gloryberry inside, lit up. When he needs it, he shakes his robes and the cylinder''s cover falls off, black smoke then pours out of it from his sleeves and neckline. Wolf manure provides the constant burn, but it''s the mayflower that provides the black smoke that looks like a dark whirlwind surrounding him. Thus, with that cover he simply climbs up using hooks worn on his arm and legs.\n\nSun Delong hears about wind and cloud, so he asks, "What kind of wind?"\n\n"Obviously, the Guiding Wind."\n\n"All I know is passing wind."\n\n"That won''t do."\n\n"Fuck it then, I''m not going without a ladder."\n\n"Don''t!"\n\nSun Delong again panics and paces in circles around the platform.\n\n"Don''t go there, the Emperor is there!"\n\n"I need to sneak a peek"\n\nMinister Xie was annoyed. Who peeks at the Emperor?\n\n"Who''s sitting there?" Sun asks,\n\n"The Emperor, obviously."\n\n"So who''s the eight giants next to him?"\n\n"That''s the guards, The Golden Macemen."\n\n"What''s that in their hands?"\n\n"The Golden Maces"\n\n"So bring the tallest one to me. I have something to discuss with him."\n\nMinister Xie goes and sees that it is in fact Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Bai Wenyuan.\n\n"Lord Bai, here''s a friend that wants to meet you, the sorcerer Sun who''s here to duel. This is Hall of Supreme Harmony Guardsman of the First Class Lord Bai Wenyuan"\n\n"Oh, Minister Bai, good tiding to you, please help me."\n\n"What do you need?"\n\n"I need to get up there"\n\n"What''s that got to do with me?"\n\n"Without you I can''t get up there."\n\n"How so?"\n\n"Think, this platform is ten meters tall, how tall are you?"\n\n"Me? His majesty only picks the tallest for his guard. I''m in fact two meters seven."\n\n"What about the golden mace?"\n\n"Handle is four meters two, three decimeters for the mace, total four meters five."\n\n"Ah, that''s right. Four meters five plus two meters seven, that''s seven meters two. It''s only a bit from ten meters."\n\nWhat''s he calculating? Bai Wenyuan wonders.\n\n"So, just let me sit on the mace, and you catapult me up there..." Sun says.\n\n"What? I...''ve never heard of this!"\n\n"If you don''t, I''m leaving."\n\nMinister Xie immediately runs over, "Lord Bai, please help him and just give it a try."\n\nBai Wenyuan was shaking with anger. Just what the hell is this? But he complies anyway. He lets Sun climb onto the mace, and vaults. With his strength, Sun flies 14 meters into the air, way past the platform. It would seem like Sun is in trouble because of the fall, but he was actually okay. Remember he has that meter and half hook? He reached the hook out to the platform to break his fall, and slid down it once it reached. Not only was he not injured, but he actually arrived standing up.\n\nThe old Taoist was meditating with his eyes closed, so he didn''t see what Sun Delong was doing at all. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was Sun descending from 14 meters in the air. He was frightened, "Wow! There are indeed talented people in China! I only rode the whirlwind, they came straight from heaven!"\n\nHe then takes a look at Sun Delong and was even more frightened, "This man has fortuitous clouds at his feet and golden light protecting his body!" The reason is, of course, that Sun had kicked the incense pot over when he landed, and the incense ash poured out around him. As for the golden light, it''s because of his oiled cotton clothes, which reflected brightly in the sunlight. Usually in battle, the side that loses their heart first loses, the old Taoist was shaking with fear. He warns himself to be careful, which only psyched himself out more. He holds out his hand and speaks.\n\n"Amita!"\n\nEven though he''s short, his voice was like a bronze bell. The old Taoist has invoked his first chant, and Sun thinks to himself that he must return one.\n\n"Good stuff!"\n\nSo the old Taoist says:\n\n"Amitabha!"\n\nAnd he hears that the old Taoist has added a syllable, so he adds a bunch.\n\n"A bunch of junk stuff!"\n\nThe old Taoist was baffled. "I don''t have that much stuff!" He thinks, "Might as well silently debate then!" He holds out a finger, which means:\n\n"Don''t underestimate me, I have The One Buddha saluting me!" \n\nSun of course, doesn''t know that. He says he knew how to silently debate, but it''s not the same thing. It''s the kind of debate he has with customers in the butchery. He sees that the old Taoist has held out a finger, and was enraged, \n\n"What''s this? He thinks he''s one generation older than me? Fuck you!"\n\nHe holds out two fingers. What does he mean?\n\n"You think you''re my uncle? Your dad''s two generations behind me!"\n\nThe old Taoist thought, "Wow! My one finger is The One Buddha saluting me, so he counters with Two Saints shielding him!" He then raises three fingers, which means "The Three August ones rules the Earth". Sun Delong doesn''t know, but he thinks:\n\n"This is a trick, he raises one so I give him two, he''s going to give me three, but if I give him four he''s giving me five, and I don''t have six fingers to give back. Therefore, I''m taking the five first!"\n\nThe old Taoist was amazed, "The Three August Ones rules the Earth" is indeed countered by "The Five Emperors are sovereign." He then slaps his chest, meaning "The One Buddha in my heart." Sun was again enraged, "So now you think you''re my father-in-law?" He slaps his head, which means "You think you''re my father-in-law? I''m slapping you and your daughter!" The old Taoist again saw that his "The One Buddha in my heart" being countered by "Heaven is above my head".\n\nThe old Taoist had to evaluate his options - he couldn''t win the silent debate, so he took the scroll paper and pulls his sword out. "What? Is he going to slit his own throat?" The Taoist cuts the paper into three pieces and drew a charm on each with the cinnabar brush. He lights the candelabrum and then the scroll with the candle. He starts chanting as he shakes his sword, and the scroll starts burning brighter, which he wants to use to burn Sun Delong. Sun Delong taunts him, "Playing with fire? Aren''t you a bit old for this? If you play with fire too much you''ll piss your bed at night, and your mother will spank you!"\n\nThe old Taoist was incensed, so he continues to spin the fire, which grew from the size of a teacup to a plate. Why didn''t it burn out the scroll? It''s because the old Taoist has applied a special formula with the cinnabar to keep it burning. He threw the flaming scroll at the other platform, and it flew towards Sun''s face. Sun dodges to the left and lets it pass, but his hair, which Ming Dynasty people usually wear in a bun on their head, caught fire, and half of his head was burnt off. Luckily for Sun, there was a bowl of rainwater on the platform, so he took it and put the fire out. The Old Taoist sees the charm has failed, so he starts burning the second one. Sun Delong sees this and was angered, "Oh, so you''re kicking me while I''m down? You want to burn the other half so I''d have to become a monk and go beg for food with you? Fuck that! I''m attacking first!" He takes his hook and aims it at the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist was still chanting with his eyes closed, which gave Sun enough time to aim. He throws the pig hook tail first towards the old Taoist "Look at this stuff!" If he didn''t yell this he''d hit the old Taoist in the face, but since he yelled, the old Taoist opens his eyes and sees something flying towards him. "Amita!" He yells and dodges to the right. The pole of course missed, but the hooks behind it didn''t, and cleaves two strands of flesh right off the old Taoist''s cheek. "Amitabhaaaaaaaaaaaa!" The old Taoist screams. Sun Delong taunts again, "Doesn''t pay attention, take this stuff!" \n\nThe old Taoist examines the pig hook and doesn''t know what it is, and becomes more frightened, "Aya! I forgot he descended from heaven and has fortuitous clouds and golden light shielding him! This man is a true arhat and even has Gautama Buddha''s Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook!"\n\nSun Delong was delighted! "Idiot! My hair can still grow back, what pot-fixer can repair your face?"\n\nThis only served to frighten the old Taoist more, as he also noticed Sun''s purse and wine bottle hanging on his belt. In his panic he thought they were the hundred-treasure pouch and heaven-flipping seal. As he kept frightening himself, he finally decided to use the foremost stratagem of the thirty six - retreat!\n\n"Amita! I''m going back to my country to report!"\n\n"If you leave I''m using my power!"\n\n"No, Don''t! I''ll report to your Emperor first!"\n\nThe old Taoist leaps off the platform and runs up to the Hall of Supreme Harmony, kowtowing again and again. "Please forgive your vassal''s transgressions! Please forgive your vassal''s transgressions!"\n\nOf course, the Emperor didn''t understand any of it. He only heard the stuff about "Amita" and "Good stuff" and didn''t get it. He then saw the old Taoist setting things on fire and then Sun Delong putting it out with water. "Of course! Water beats fire!" He then saw the old Taoist lighting fire again, and was annoyed, but then while he was staring at the fire, he saw that the Taoist''s cheeks were then gashed. He clapped happily, "We''ve won! Good! Good!" He saw that the old Taoist has descended and knew that the old Taoist admitted defeat.\n\n"What do you have to say?"\n\n"Ah! Your majesty! Please forgive us! We admit defeat and will tribute and declare every year!"\n\n"Of course! We must know, however, what is ''Amita''?"\n\n"That''s how we Taoists greet people."\n\n"What about his ''Good stuff''?"\n\n"I don''t know, what''s good stuff?"\n\n"What about ''Amitabha''?"\n\n"It''s also a greeting."\n\n"What about his ''A bunch of junk stuff!''?"\n\n"He has too much stuff" The old Taoist points to his cheek "Look at this stuff I took!"\n\n"Then what was that finger?"\n\n"The One Buddha saluting me!" \n\n"What about his two?"\n\n"Two Saints shielding him!" \n\n"What about your three?"\n\n"''The Three August Ones rules the Earth'', then your sorcerer counters with ''The Five Emperors are sovereign.'' I slapped my chest meaning ''The One Buddha in my heart'', and he counters with a slap on his head meaning ''Heaven is above my head''".\n\n"So what about that fire?"\n\n"Please forgive me! I wanted to toss him off the platform."\n\n"For a man of mercy you sure are merciless! What about your face?"\n\n"Eight Treasures As-You-Will Purple Gold Hook."\n\nSo then he was dismissed and goes to await the Emperor''s judgment.\n\nThe Emperor''s attendant then looks on the platform "Wait, why is our sorcerer still up there?" Of course, Sun Delong couldn''t get down, and he''s pacing on the platform wondering if he had won or not. The Emperor sees and says, "Our sorcerer must be wounded by that demon fire, have somebody help him down." So immediately a ladder was raised and Sun Delong gets off the platform. Minister Xie walks over and says, "The Emperor requires your audience, just kowtow and try not to speak." Why? He''s still afraid of that possible "Hey bro, long time no see". Sun Delong enters the Hall of Supreme Harmony and salutes the Emperor, "Hey!" \n\nAre you going to bite me? The Emperor wonders, but then Sun says.\n\n"I am kowtowing to your majesty."\n\nOf course, since he won, the Emperor was happy, "Raise your head."\n\nNormally, it''s against protocol to raise your head and you''re supposed to say, "It''s a crime to" and the Emperor would then say, "We pardon it'', but Sun Deleng doesn''t know that and raises his head immediately to stare at the Emperor, "What?"\n\nThe Emperor laughed, "So did you win or not?"\n\nSun Delong is afraid of this, because he doesn''t know if he won or not. He lowers his head. The Emperor asks again, "Did you win or not?" He turns his head and sees the old Taoist, so when the Emperor asks a third time, he answers, "Your majesty, I can''t answer that. If I say I won, then I''m boasting, but if I say I didn''t win, what did I come here for? If you don''t have the skills you don''t get the kills."\n\nMinister Xie is annoyed, "What''s all this small talk?"\n\n"Please don''t ask me who won, you should ask him. If he says I lost then I lost, if I said I won then I won. Old Taoist! If you say I lost, then let''s go back up there for round two!"\n\nThe old Taoist holds his cheek and says, "Please no! He won!"\n\n"What''s the sorcerer''s name?" The Emperor asks.\n\n"My name is Sun Delong and I live in the butchery street. The Delong Butchery is mine. I''ve never cheated a customer and you''ll always get 16 ounces to your pound!"\n\nWho asked him about that?\n\n"So after you met, what''s ''Amita''?" The Emperor asks.\n\n"Oh that''s simple! I know him."\n\nThe old Taoist was surprised. He knows me? I don''t know him?\n\n"This man is here to beg for money."\n\n"Why ''Amita''?"\n\n"In my butchery, whenever someone comes to beg, if it''s a monk they''ll say ''Mitabha'', if it''s a Taoist they''ll say, "Amita'', both means ''Give me money.''"\n\n"Then what''s ''Good stuff''?"\n\n"I said ''Good stuff'' because I was thinking, ''How the hell is there another one when two already begged from me?"\n\nThe old Taoist starts to grimace.\n\n"Then in the silent debate, what''s that one finger?"\n\nSun Delong however started thinking: Maybe the Emperor is going to punish the old Taoist, and the worst punishment is the nine familial exterminations. If I tell the Emperor about that generation stuff, then even if it''s four generations apart it''s still not out of the nine. I need to say something else. This is where the old Taoist is finally mentally slain:\n\n"Your majesty, we were discussing business."\n\n"How so? He sticks one out, you stick two, he then sticks three and you stick five. He slaps his chest and you slap your head. Isn''t that silent debate?"\n\n"No, your majesty, it''s business"\n\n"What kind of business?"\n\n"He knows I''m a butcher, and in his temple there''s going to be a feast, so he wants to buy a pig. I tell him go ahead, I even have two for you. He wants one that''s at least three hundred pounds, I tell him I''ve got ones that''s more than five hundred pounds, he asks if the heart, liver and lungs come with it, and I tell him that he can have the pig head too!"\n\ntl''dr: Chinese xiangsheng piece parallel of the Muslim Ban joke that u/GaryV83_at_Work put up.\n\n\n\n\n\n$$, ''5t5d9i'', 0, $$The Duel (Extremely Long)$$);

It serves, therefore, as a valuable cautionary tale.\n\nThe first flaw in the anecdote\x2019s construction is in its gratuitous use of ethnicity as a crutch. To be sure, Jews serve as an invaluable comedy resource. Any joke involving miserliness of any kind can be improved by the addition of a Hebraic surname (or, in the alternative, by the addition of the prefix \x201cMac.\x201d) But here, \x201cJewishness\x201d does not improve the comedy one wit. Any ethnicity will scream when placed in an oven. You throw an Irishman into an oven, and see if he doesn\x2019t cry out \x201cBegosh and begorrah, I\x2019ve been thrown into an oven!\x201d So too the Mexican, whose refrain of \x201cAi yi yi, es mui caliente!\x201d is equally plausible. Indeed, the only person who should ever be thrown into an oven in comedy is Sylvia Plath.\n\nMany of you may object, \x201cBut what of the Holocaust? Surely that validates the choice of \x2018Jew\x2019 in the set-up?\x201d\n\nFar from it. One must be very careful when relying on history as validation. The Nazis threw very few screaming Jews into the oven. This is not Holocaust revisionism, it\x2019s simply fact. The Germans are a very efficient people, and they killed almost all their victims before disposing of their bodies in factory-like furnaces. To do otherwise would slow their production lines of death down, and that would be intolerable to the German psyche. No, no. The corpses that were thrown into the ovens went in not unlike the aforementioned pizza \x2013 silently.\n\nThus, the fundamental logic of the joke is ruined. The difference does not hold up under historical scrutiny. \n\nSo when you are asked to contemplate the difference between a Jew and a pizza, plausible answer is: \x201cOne is a human being with a human soul and a human mind and inherent human dignity, and the other is a molded dough product.\x201d Or \x201cYou take the pizza out of the oven in one piece.\x201d\n\n$$, ''5szfuc'', 0, $$What is the difference between a Jew and a pizza?$$);

One cold winter''s morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment''s hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. "How can I ever thank you sir?" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. "Just name your price - I''m a wealthy man."\n\n"Ah, well..." stammers the tramp, "... uh, I''m a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out."\n\n"Oh dear," says the father, "I don''t carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I''ll get more from the safe."\n\n"No! No!" says the tramp, "Why ten pounds is more money than I''ve seen in my whole life - that''ll be plenty."\n\n"Ten pounds," thinks the tramp, "I''m rich! I''m rich!" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. "I''ll have one holiday please!"\n\n"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n"Oh, any holiday I don''t mind, anything up to ten pounds," replies the tramp.\n\n"TEN POUNDS! You''ll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds," says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n"Well you''ll never believe it," she says to the tramp, back in the shop. "I''ve got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds."\n\n"Yippee!" exclaims the tramp, "I''ll take it!"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n"But I''ve got my ticket!'', responds the tramp, "super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!"\n\n"Well okay," says the captain, "but you can''t come on just now, I don''t want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it''s dark and I''ll let you on then."\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n"Psst," says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n"Hurry up, it''s midnight, let''s get you to your cabin."\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew''s quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7'' x 4'' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n"Sheer luxury!" exclaimed the tramp, "A room of my very own."\n\n"I''m glad you like it," replies the captain, "but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that''s what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise."\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he''d ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he''d have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who''d grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n"That was amazing!" exclaimed the captain, "Where did you learn to dive like that?"\n\n"Um, well I''ve never actually dived before," replied the tramp.\n\n"Well that''s incredible!" says the captain, "I''ve never seen..." He broke off. "Hey, I''ve got an idea'', he started again. "How would you like to train a bit, and we''ll put on a show for the other passengers. I''ll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!"\n\n"It''s a deal!" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he''s never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. "Okay, I''d like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We''re going to erect a high diving board for you."\n\n"Okay," agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n"Well, tramp," said the captain, shaking his hand, "Let''s see what you can do."

He had been riding for about an hour and passed all sorts of country sights. A tractor in a field. Cows grazing. A canopy tunnel of trees. And different novelty mailboxes including a bright pink one. . Suddenly a downpour came upon him. The sudden rain made the roads very slippery and he wound up laying the bike over in a ditch. This caused some parts to come loose and hoses break. He reached for his phone but  it was soaked and unable to turn on after the accident.\n\nStranded and alone, he decided to walk down the road back the way he came. The pink mailbox was less than a mile away and he figured there was a house nearby. As he finally started to reach the pink mailbox, he noticed there were pink flowers planted around it. He thought nothing of it and made his way down the long now-muddy road. After a few minutes he came upon a huge pink gate with pink railings and a pink call box.\n\nThe man rang the pink box and a pink tinted screen came on with an old lady answering,\x201cHello?\x201d\n\n\x201cHello,\x201d said the man. \x201cI\x2019ve been riding down the road and had an accident. Would it be alright if I came in and used your phone? My cell phone is soaked.\x201d\n\n\x201cOf course!\x201d said the old woman. And the huge pink gate gave a creak as it opened up.\n\nThe man walked through the huge pink gate and walked up to her house. It was a massive, 3-story, colonial style house with a porch that wrapped completely around. And it was all pink. The house had pink bushes planted in front. Pink steps with pink banisters led up to the pink porch with pink rocking chairs and pink ceiling fans. He walked up and rang the pink doorbell which gave out a very bright and pleasant \x201cding.\x201d \n\nThe large pink front door opened up and the old woman greeted him with a smile. She was wearing a pink nightgown and pink slippers.\n\n\x201cPlease, come in,\x201d she said, and motioned her little hand inside.\n\nAs the man stepped inside, his jaw dropped. Every single thing inside the house was pink. The tile on the floor was two-toned, checkerboard style pink. The curtains we pink with pink embroidery embellishments. Even the frames on the windows were pink. He took a step and started to take his muddy boots off when he noticed the pink umbrella holder and pink coat rack. \n\n\x201cYou are soaked to the bone! Would you like a towel to dry off?\x201d asked the little pink woman.\n\n\x201cYes, please,\x201d answered the man.\n\n\x201cGo into the kitchen. The telephone is in there,\x201d she instructed, as she went into another room.\n\nThe man made his way across the entry room into the kitchen. His hand lightly swept across the pink dresser, along the pink walls and pink trim, down the pink door frame, and to the small pink dining table. He sat in a pink chair and picked up the pink rotary phone. Even the telephone wire was pink. He attempted to dial a number but the phone seemed to be disconnected.\n\nThe little pink lady came in with a large pink towel and handed it to the man. It was warm as if it had just come out of the clothes dryer.\n\n\x201cThank you so much,\x201d said the man. \x201cBut I think your phone is disconnected because of the storm.\x201d\n\nThe pink lady responded,\x201dOh, that\x2019s a shame. Well, if you need to you can stay in one of the guest bedrooms for the night.\x201d\n\nThe man thanked her for her kindness and made his way up the pink stairs, holding onto the pink banister. He walked down the pink hallway with pink wallpaper. He walked into a bedroom and found it to be completely pink. On the pink bed were some pink pajamas, a pink robe, another pink towel, and a pink travel toothbrush wrapped in plastic. He took the pink towel, pink robe, and pink toothbrush and went to the bathroom to wash up before bed.\n\nIn the bathroom, the man undressed and used the pink soap and pink shampoo to wash himself. Then he dried himself with the pink towel and put on the pink robe. He used the pink sink to brush his teeth with the pink toothbrush with the pink toothpaste that was already in the pink bathroom.\n\nHe then went back into the pink bedroom and changed into his pink pajamas. He laid down on the bed and covered himself with the pink blanket and pink sheet. Then, laying his head down on the pink pillow, he fell right to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, the man woke up and made his way downstairs. In the hallway, he ran into two other men. They introduced themselves and explained to each other why they were there. One man had slid into a ditch near the motorcycle accident and lost his phone. The other man was the pink lady\x2019s nephew who came in earlier that morning. \n\nAfter making their way down, they came upon the little old lady was already dressed in a pink top and pink pants with little pink shoes. She was carrying the man\x2019s clothes and asked the gentlemen if they would like breakfast.\n\n\x201cWould you like bacon and eggs or oatmeal?\x201d she asked.\n\n\x201cI\x2019ll have oatmeal, Auntie.\x201d\n\n\x201cI\x2019ll have bacon and eggs,\x201d said the man in the car accident.\n\n\x201cI\x2019ll have bacon and eggs, as well,\x201d said the man in the motorcycle accident.\n\n\x201cVery good,\x201d said the little pink lady. \n\nShe made the breakfast with her pink cooking utensils and pink pots and pans. The bacon sizzled and steam rose into the pink vent. She took out some pink plates and pink silverware and set them on the table where the men were seated. She brought down some pink glasses and poured each man some strawberry milk.\n\nThey all ate and were satisfied with their breakfast. The man tried the phone again and it was working. He called his wife and asked her to come pick him up. The man in the car accident used the phone and asked his roommate to pick him up.\n\nA few hours later, the wife and the roommate both show up and pick up their respective husband and friend. And they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThere is one conclusion we can take from this story.\n\nTwo out of three men prefer bacon and eggs over oatmeal.$$, ''5suzgr'', 4, $$One fine evening a man was riding his motorcycle...$$);

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.\n\nLater the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!"\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he''d won. "I haven''t a clue," the Mufti said. "First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it ''the finger.'' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!" "And then what?" asked a woman. "Who knows?" said the Mufti.

After getting home, he looks around for non-food items to eat with potatoes, and eventually settles on the idea of trying to eat a Biro.\n\nSo he smashes the Biro into small pieces, combines it with a few potatoes, puts the mixture in a savoury pastry, and bakes it for a while. After it''s baked, he''s slightly less drunk and realises it''s not such a great idea to try and eat a Biro, but he knows his friends won''t let him forget it if he reneges on his commitment, so he eats it anyway.

The challenge was for someone to get the elephant to take all four feet off the ground at once without using any device that would actually lift the elephant from the ground such as a crane, hoist, or the like, if successful they would receive a 10,000 dollar cash prize, but the catch was they had to pay 100 dollars to try.\n\nTurned out people came from far and wide, even other countries. Everyone tried everything they could from coaxing to hypnosis to threats, but try as they might everyone failed in their attempt. \n\nFrank was elated, his scheme was working brilliantly and he was making some nice dough.\n\nOne day a blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n"Good afternoon sir, Is it true that if I can get your elephant to take all his feet off the ground at once I''ll win 10,000 dollars?"\n\nFrank replied. "Good afternoon to you too sir, yes it is true, but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt."\n\nThe man nodded and agreed.

He pulled out an old fashioned wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat and walked up and looked the elephant in the eye. \n\nA few moments later he walked around behind the elephant, took a stable stance and took a home run swing at the elephants testicles that would have made the Babe proud. The elephant trumpeted out and jumped into the air taking all four feet off the ground. \n\nFrank stood with his mouth gaping open and reluctantly handed the 10 000 dollars to the stranger. The man got into his car and drove off.\n\nA few months later Frank began to get low on funds again. Although his challenge had been won, he had still made a good profit. \n\nBut now he began to try and think of another scam to make even more money, this time, find one that couldn''t be accomplished.\nSo Frank came up with a new challenge and once again put it in the newspapers and on T.V. \n\nThis time he was sure of his challenge. He had seen elephants move their heads up and down but because of their anatomy they couldn''t move it from left to right, only twist it left and right. Once again a 10,000 dollar prize was offered, and a 100 dollar fee to try.\n\nSo once again people came from far and wide, again even from other countries. Again everything from coaxing to hypnosis to threats were employed but all those who tried failed in their attempt.\n\nOne day a familiar blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n"Good afternoon sir. Is it true that if I can get your elephant to move his head from left to right, I''ll win 10,000 dollars?"\n\nFrank swallowed hard and replied. "Afternoon sir, yes it is true but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt."\n\nOnce again the man nodded and agreed. He handed Frank the 100 dollars and once again walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out the same wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat, still stained with the elephants blood from the first encounter and walked up to the elephant.\n\nHe paused and looked the elephant in the eye, a few moments later he asked. "Remember me?"\n\nThe elephant nodded it''s head up and down "Yes."\n\n"Want me to do it again?"\n\nThe elephant shook it''s head from left to right. "No."$$, ''5smx3s'', 8, $$Elephants Never Forget$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$Hey, my name\x2019s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must\x2019ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, \x201cHey Mike! You\x2019ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!\x201d I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother\x2019s grandfather\x2019s nephew\x2019s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he\x2019d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn\x2019t always bad.\n\nGood old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don\x2019t think he liked it much. He didn\x2019t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn\x2019t start running after five minutes. I\x2019m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family\x2019s latest adventures.\n\nThere was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. \x201cYou know Michael,\x201d he started as I prepared my apology, \x201cI really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don\x2019t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.\x201d I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.\n\nOur year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert\x2019s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.\n\nWork was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn\x2019t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.\n\nFrom the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.\n\nHowever, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance.\x00a0Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy\x2019s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, \x201cMikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don\x2019t do anything stupid.\x201d\n\nThe standoff lasted for hours. If it weren\x2019t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn\x2019t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy\x2019s voice at one point yelling orders like, \x201cDimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.\x201d None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, \x201cClear!\x201d As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today\x2019s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes.\x00a0God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this?\x00a0When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.\n\n\x201cMike! Thank God you\x2019re still alive. I\x2019m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.\x201d\n\n\x201cWhat? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?\x201d\n\n\x201cWe found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn\x2019t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.\x201d He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.\n\nI frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. \x201cRobert?\x201d I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. \x201cYou mean to tell me that all of these guys\x2026 They\x2019re all your family?\x201d\n\nRobert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, \x201cI told you we don\x2019t forget Mike.\x00a0All the Goodings come to Doe\x2019s who wait. \x201d$$, ''5sk2ge'', 215, $$The Story of Mike Doe!$$);

"I''ve got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds."\n\n"Yippee!" exclaims the tramp, "I''ll take it!"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n"But I''ve got my ticket!'', responds the tramp, "super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!"\n\n"Well okay," says the captain, "but you can''t come on just now, I don''t want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it''s dark and I''ll let you on then."\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n"Psst," says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n"Hurry up, it''s midnight, let''s get you to your cabin."\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew''s quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7'' x 4'' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n"Sheer luxury!" exclaimed the tramp, "A room of my very own."\n\n"I''m glad you like it," replies the captain, "but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that''s what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise."\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he''d ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he''d have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who''d grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n"That was amazing!" exclaimed the captain, "Where did you learn to dive like that?"\n\n"Um, well I''ve never actually dived before," replied the tramp.\n\n"Well that''s incredible!" says the captain, "I''ve never seen..." He broke off. "Hey, I''ve got an idea'', he started again. "How would you like to train a bit, and we''ll put on a show for the other passengers. I''ll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!"\n\n"It''s a deal!" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he''s never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. "Okay, I''d like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We''re going to erect a high diving board for you."\n\n"Okay," agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n"Well, tramp," said the captain, shaking his hand, "Let''s see what you can do." And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\ntill the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\nhe jumped.\n\nSlowly at first,\n\nbut speeding up,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\nspeeding past Pluto,\n\nand the other outer planets,\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n"I CAN SEE HIM!" yelled a passenger, "LOOK!!!"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW''S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37'' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n"HERO!" "WONDERFUL!" "AMAZING!" "GOOD SHOW THAT!"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen."\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, "but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it."\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: "Well you see...\n\nI''m a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI''ve been through many a hard ship in my life."\n$$, ''5sbp3d'', 266, $$The Tramp''s Holiday$$);

So they did.\nHowever, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.\n\nFurious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once!

He decides to wander the woods near his childhood home. After wandering for a while he comes upon an old,  beat down, shack. It looks empty so he opens the door to explore inside. "Hello'', a voice greets him from a dark corner. "I am so sorry! I thought it was abandoned. I''ll leave now." he replies,  shocked that someone could live here. "No, no,  please stay a moment. I haven''t had company in years." the elderly woman says, with a smile. "Yeah, I guess I can stay, I don''t have anywhere else to be." the boy says, returning the smile. They talk for a couple hours before teenage boy has to leave to get home for dinner. "Thank you for being so hospitable. I had a good time" the young man says to his new friend. "I am the one who is truly grateful. Please take these as a gift for your time." she hands him a pair of ugly, colorful, but clean, socks. "Thank you?" he says, confused. "I can''t help you make friends with people your own age but these socks may give you some courage to open up more." says the grateful woman. They spend time together at least weekly, and their friendship grows, but the socks remain unused in a drawer. One morning teenage boy has no clean white socks and in a rush to catch the bus put the socks given to him by his elderly friend. When he arrives to school everyone he passes smiles and greets him. "Odd'', he thinks. At lunch, the popular kids ask him to sit at their table. Before the end of the lunch hour the prettiest cheerleader in school is kissing his cheek. When he gets home he tosses all his other socks out and puts his lucky ones in the wash. The next morning he puts on his socks and gets on the bus.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$After a long day on the job, a construction worker makes his way home. He is happy to find the bus goes express, and he gets to his apartment building in record time. He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. "It''s not what you think!" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there''s not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can''t find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, "I''ll kill you!'', pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. \n\n\nThe next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, "Well my son, how did you die?"\n\n"Well," replies the husband " I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn''t satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am."\n\n"Oh boy." Replied Saint Peter "Well, while I''m sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I''m afraid you have to go to hell." With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. \n\nSaint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. "And how did you die, my son?"\n\nThe guy looks perplexed. "It was the strangest thing, sir. I was sitting at home trying to work out, but my apartment is so small I have to be creative and do pull ups outside my window. Well, I was doing this like normal, when all of a sudden a crazy guy starts throwing things at me. I lost my grip and fell, and somehow by God''s grace, I didn''t die! I started thanking God, but then the guy suddenly pushed out a fridge, and it landed directly on me!"\n\nSaint Peter scratches his head. "I am sorry, son. You lived a good life, and as a reward, you get to go to heaven." And with that, the guy is ushered to heaven. \n\nSaint Peter beckons the next person in line, who walks up.

He would unload all the cookies and make the three-day-long drive back to the factory. He''d been working at the company for years, and was quite reputable.\n\nOne day, he loaded up his trailer and hit the road. After driving for hours, he stopped at a truck stop and inspected his cargo as he normally would, just to make sure everything''s okay. When he opened up the doors, there was a hole in one of the packages! He looked around the trailer and his eyes landed on a cookie, walking around the boxes! The driver couldn''t believe it, but grabbed the cookie, stuffed it back in the box and taped it shut. "That should take care of it," he thought. After getting a cup of coffee, he started driving again. \n\nWhen he stopped for the night, the driver thought that he better check and make sure that cookie wasn''t out of the box again. He opened the doors again, saw the broken box and a cookie doing the Charleston! The driver thought he was going insane, but there it was; a dancing cookie. He brought out the duct tape and sealed the cookie back in the box, then went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, the truck driver woke up a the crack of dawn, thinking that last night''s events were only a dream. After getting a bagel and coffee from a restaurant, he started up his truck and hit the road, jamming to the radio. Once he was fully awake, he remembered the cookie and realized it wasn''t a dream. Slamming on the brakes, he took the nearest off ramp from the highway, swung the trailer doors open. Lo and behold, the cookie box had a new hole in it, and the cookie was leading a one cookie conga line on top! Furious, the driver snatched the cookie up, crammed it into the box, and covered the entire box in tape. Pleased that he wouldn''t have to worry about the cookie again, he kept driving until the sun went down.\n\nOn the third day, after a peaceful night''s sleep, the truck driver started on the last leg of the journey to the buyer. He didn''t even check the trailer for the cookie, being sure that it couldn''t get through the tape. \n\nWhen he finally arrived at his destination, the driver checked in at the office and backed his truck up to the loading dock. As the unloading staff opened the doors, a small brown object fell out of a box. They didn''t notice anything until they had unloaded a few boxes; one of the boxes was covered in tape and had a hole in it! Thinking it may have been caused by mice, they called over their supervisor. After taking one look, the supervisor called the driver''s company, explained what happened, hung up and spoke two small words to the driver:\n\n"You''re fired."\n\nDevastated, the driver didn''t know what to do. He grabbed the offending box and stepped back into his eighteen-wheeler and sat there for a minute, in shock. Something caught his eye on the dashboard. It was the cookie, doing the moonwalk. The driver didn''t make an effort to put the cookie back into the box, it didn''t matter any more.\n\nHe drove to the beach, took the box of cookies, and sat at the end of a pier with the cookie next to him, tap dancing. "I hope you''re happy," he said to the cookie. "You got me fired from a job I worked at for years, a job I was happy doing. Now what am I supposed to do?" The cookie didn''t look at him and kept dancing. The driver became madder and madder. "You think that''s funny? How about THIS?!"

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$The old bell ringer had passed away and the bishop set out a sign announcing that the position was now open for new applicants.  A few weeks go by without  any bites, but one day a man comes in.  The man had a hunched back and no arms, so the bishop was leary of his ability to perform the job, but the Lord teaches love and acceptance of all.  He says to the man, "if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours."  \n\nElated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church''s bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.\n\nWeeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, "does anyone know this man?"  Another replies...\n\n"No, but his face sure rings a bell!"\n\nWith a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.\n\nTo ensure the new ringer''s safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, "does anyone know this man?"

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$An ageing prison facility is constantly beset by long queues for the shower area, which the managers decide to do something about because having all the prisoners together in one area outside of their cells might get nasty. So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.\n\nSo they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers'' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn''t do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.\n\nWhen the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there''s a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.\n\nOf course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: "What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!"\n\nThe technician says, calmly, "I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed..."\n\nThis does nothing to assuage the managers'' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have know that there would be a power cut.

They were driving in a rental car along a rather deserted highway. It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. \n\nSuddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. \n\nMoments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. \n\nBob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. \n\nA minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, "Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We''ve been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??" \n\n"I''m sorry," replied the hunchback, "but we don''t have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!" \n\nBob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. "I''m afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory." \n\nWith that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. \n\nAfter a brief examination, Igor''s master looks worried. "Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion." Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. \n\nThe Hills'' deaths upset Igor''s master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty''s hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob''s arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! \n\nUnable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: \n\n"Master, Master! ...

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, "Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?"\n\nThe son hesitated a moment and his father''s thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\n\nFinally, the son said, "Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball."\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, "If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have."\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n\n"Father," replied the son, "I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls."\n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, "If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have."\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\n"Father," said the son to this, "I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls."\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. "A carton of pink ping pong balls?"\n\n"A carton of pink ping pong balls," the boy confirmed.\n\n"I can''t understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls," said the father, "but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have." And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n"Dear son," said the father, "I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?"\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. "Please humour me, dear father."\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son''s 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. "Dearest father," the son started, "I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls." One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son''s wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son''s 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n"Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible." It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\n"Father," the son said, "You''ve made me very happy yet again." That night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. "My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?"\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. "Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls."\n\nThe father held his son''s hand tightly. "Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls."\n\n"Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls."\n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n\n"Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls."\n\nThe son nodded weakly.\n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son''s hospital room.\n\n"Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls," the father requested.\n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n\n"I-" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n"I- I-"\n\nThen he died.$$, ''5s0p6s'', 856, $$A day before his 15th birthday$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$he was the original gangster copied a million times over here goes.. his words : Last weekend I saw something at Larry''s Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife, Toni. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!   Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I''d get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.   Awesome!!!   Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.   Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn''t be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?  \n \nThere I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong?   So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.\n \nThe directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.   All the while I''m looking at this little device measuring about 5" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, "no possible way!"   What happened next is almost beyond description, but I''ll do my best.....   I''m sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, "don''t do it master," reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn''t hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it.\n \nI touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$$!% !@*!!!   I''m pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs. The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, "do it again, do it again!"   Note: If you ever feel compelled to "mug" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself. You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered conservative.   SON-OF-A- ... that hurt like hell!!!\n \nA minute or so later (I can''t be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantle of the fireplace. How did they get up there??? My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novacaine, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I''m still looking for my testicles. I''m offering a significant reward for their safe return.

In his bathtub, sink, toilet, fridge, freezer, penguins everywhere. His house is practically bursting with these penguins.\n\n The mans wife is obviously not impressed with the amount of penguins her husband has.\n\n"Honey," she said to him, "You have got to get rid of all these penguins.

The donation coordinator exclaimed "We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!"\n\nThe man smiled to himself.

At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn''t be too far away so he could go visit. \n\n"My wife says I need to get rid of them today"\n\n"Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!"\n\nIt was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.\n\n"Damn it!!" The man thought to himself. "The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins." \n\nIt was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.\n\n"Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don''t take these penguins to the County Zoo today."\n\n"You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?" replied the stranger.\n\n"Yes! Please! I''ll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?"\n\nThe stranger took the money.\n\n"Yeah, that should be enough."\n\nSo the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.\n\nAfter a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.\n\n"What is your problem?" Scoffed the security guard.\n\n"Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?" Pleaded the man.\n\n"Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them."\n\n"WHAT!?!" The man was furious!! "That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!"\n\n"Sorry, sir."\n\nThe man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.\n\nAfter, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.\n\nThe man slammed on his breaks.\n\nHe hopped out of his car.\n\nHe approached the stranger and said,\n\n"Hey!

He was a part of people\x2019s lives, from their first prom, to valentines gifts, birthdays, weddings, and even funerals -- he loved his work, and the town loved him. Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.\n\nAll that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself \x201cwell, I\x2019m sure this town can support two florists,\x201d so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. \n\nBut as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you\x2019d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.\n\nOne day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said \x201cguys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I\x2019m going to lose it.\x201d The friars told him to fuck off.\n\nHe went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. \x201cMy family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.\x201d She was again told to fuck off.\n\nIn a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. \x201cPlease sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.\x201d They too were told to fuck off.\n\nNext, John\x2019s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.\n\nSitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he\x2019s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family \x2013 acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn\x2019t a good guy. John\x2019s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. \n\nJohn explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said \x201cI\x2019ll deal with it\x201d and hung up the phone. \n\nTwo days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.\n\nThe moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.$$, ''5rwlos'', 233, $$John owned the local florist shop.$$);

It will improve in two weeks. \n\nThat evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. \n\nJack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. \n\nThe computer prints the following:\n \n1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. \n2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. \n3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. \n4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren''t yours. Get a lawyer. \n5.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.\n\nThe first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight''s armor.\n\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\n\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.$$, ''5rm3ul'', 11, $$Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms$$);

She replied, "$165,000!" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, "Madam, I''m surprised you''re carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?" The old lady replied, "I make bets." The president then asked, "Bets? What kind of bets?" The old woman said, "Well, for example, I''ll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square." The president laughs, "That''s a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!" The old lady challenged, "So, would you like to take my bet?" The president agrees, "Sure, I''ll bet $25,000 that my balls aren''t square!" The little old lady then said, "Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10am as a witness?"\n"Sure!" replied the confident president.\n\nThat night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again.

The next morning, at precisely 10am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president''s office.\n\nShe introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet "$25,000 says the president''s balls are square!" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. "Well, Okay," said the president, "$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure."\n\nJust then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, "What the hell''s the matter with your lawyer?"

The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.\n\nOne day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said "Hey, I''ve got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I''ll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day."\n\nThe staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.\n\nThe staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure.

The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.\n\nOne fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.\n\nThe lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. "SAVE ME!!! I''M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!" he yelled.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.\n\nLondon of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.\n\nThe first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.\n\nBy the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames\x2026 no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.\n\nHe, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil\x2019s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster\x2019s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.\n\nOn August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.\n\nLondon in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars\x2026 warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.\n\nThe battle was truly a footnote to his preparation\x2026 Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.\n\nHonorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.\n\nThe beast broke the surface.\n\nNo human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus\x2019 left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.\n\nThe monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster\x2019s eye.\n\nAngered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster\x2019s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.\n\nOnce he had braced himself inside the beast\x2019s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.\n\nWhen his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus\x2019 \x201cluck\x201d in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus\x2019 blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water\x2019s rush against the beast\x2019s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, \x201cAugust 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?\x201d\n\nTwo weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.\n\nThe body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.\n\nHonorus\x2019 solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.\n\nA bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London\x2019s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.\n\nStill, Honorus has one final contribution to this history\x2026 It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus\x2019 injuries.\n\nAfter the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.\n\nOne week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus\x2019 foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.\n\nIn the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus\x2019 sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing\x2019s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:\x2026 It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames\x2026$$, ''5rfiij'', 21, $$A monster in london$$);

He had missed the train and so had to take his car instead. His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.\n\nSo he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone''s gps to find an alternate route.\n\nHe exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.\n\nAs he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.\n\nHe got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.\n\nHe coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.\n\nSo having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.\n\nHe continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it''s worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.\n\nA bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn''t the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.\n\nHe decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.\n\nThe man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.\n\n"can I help you?" asks the butler\n\n"yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don''t have cell signal and..."\n\n"follow me." said the butler, sternly cutting him off.\n\nHe follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.\n\nThe butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.\n\n"what did they say?" asked the butler.\n\n"they can''t send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb..."\n\n"Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms." says the butler cutting him off again.\n\nHe follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.\n\n"geez," says the man, chuckling to himself, "do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?"\n\nThe butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.\n\n"we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something."\n\nThe butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.\n\n"you must never touch the pink gorilla!" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nThe butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.\n\nNot sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can''t stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It''s not like he would have found the cage by accident.\n\nHe eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn''t decide if what he saw was real or not.\n\nSo he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn''t want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...\n\nSHHHOOOK BAM!\n\nHe froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.\n\nThe door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.\n\nThe gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nHe frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn''t sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.\n\nJust as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn''t open for him. So he began to climb.\n\nHe got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla''s cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.\n\nRunning as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won''t start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.\n\nThe gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man''s cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,\n\n"you''re it."$$, ''5rfhvu'', 20, $$the pink gorilla$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n"You''re in the afterlife!" he tells the man, "But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here."\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they''re all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. "That one''s the bread line, that''s the broth line, and that''s the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you''ve got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I''ve heard the food is better there."\n\nSo the man gets his food. It''s abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It''s nothing too fancy, if anything, it''s a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n"What are the odds?" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone''s attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man''s wonder and points to each line in turn. "That''s the hot dog line, that''s the salad line, and that''s the lemonade line." The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he''s eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, "The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn''t like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn''t too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn''t you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. "Come," the beggar told him, "I''ll take you to the evening meal." So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. "That''s the steak line, that''s the soup line, and that''s the champagne line," and then he added, "and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. "What is it," he thought, "that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. "I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I''ve come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. "That''s the line for the dragon meat," he said before turning to the next line, "and that''s the line for angeldust stew," then he paused, confused.\n\n"What is it?" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, "There appears to be no punchline."\n\nEDIT: if you liked this joke, go to r/feghoot for more like this one!\n\nEDIT 2: To people screaming repost, i gave credit to  u/insolent_swine in the comments.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$Once upon a time, there was a prince of a certain land, who wanted to be a lowly fisherman when he grew up. But try as he could, he couldn''t ever catch a single fish. He had tried many methods, including nets, spears, and traps, but all to no avail.\n\nFurthermore, he was looked down upon by the rest of his family. While he should have been heir to the throne, he spent so much time trying to fish and failing that he was unsuited to the position. Furthermore, he had hardly wanted to become king anyway, and saw no real need for him to fill the position. Eventually, his family disowned him and he had to live his own life in a small hut.\n\nOne day, he met an old man by the lake shore, who was hungry and begging. The prince was down to his last few coins in his purse, but he gave them to the old man anyway. Not entirely out of altruism, mind you. He simply thought the old man would be able to have more use with the money than he would, considering what a failure he was at fishing.\n\nThe old man looked up at him and smiled, asking him "I see you have a fishing net. Would you like to learn the secret to fishing?"\n\nThe prince, obviously just having given away absolutely everything, had little choice but to agree. So obviously, he did.\n\nThe old man told him, "Come closer."\n\nThe prince did so.\n\nThe old man whispered in his ear, "Beyond the desert to the east is a huge ocean where the water is sweet and bubbling. Many fish swim in it, for there are plenty of nutrients in the water. You will surely get some fish there."\n\nThe prince said, "I understand," and started to set off.\n\nThe old man called after him, "Wait, you''ll need this!" and gave the prince a fishing pole.\n\n"This fishing pole is enchanted. It will draw fish towards it. You''ll see."\n\nThe prince scrounged up what he could for the journey. He took the last of the bread he had, some water from the lake, and left his hut abandoned.\n\nHe started crossing the desert. The blistering heat beat down on him. Halfway through the desert, he noticed someone was following him. He turned towards them and asked if they had brought any water with them.\n\n"Yes, but you haven''t kept up your interest payments. Pay me and I''ll throw in the water as a free bonus. Otherwise, I guess you won''t be needing your left hand."\n\nTrue to the old man''s word, the fishing rod had indeed attracted a loan-shark (though the prince didn''t realize this at the time). Not wanting to be killed or tortured or whatnot, the prince quickly thought up a plan.\n\n"Yes, it''s right here," he said, rummaging through his bag.\n\nHe took out the stale bread, which had hardened to a brick, and threw it at the shark, stunning him for a moment.\n\nHe turned and fled, running through the desert. His throat was parching, and every step he took against the slippery sands seemed to resist him all the way. Meanwhile, the loan-shark was calmly walking towards him.\n\nSomehow, the prince managed to outrun the loan-shark. He made it to the edge of the bubbling ocean, as the old man had predicted. There, he saw a boat with some fishing supplies in them. He climbed in and started to figure out how to use the fishing rod.\n\nTrue to the old man''s word, the moment he cast his hook into the bubbling, fizzy waters, strange fish did indeed start biting almost immediately. He ended pulling fish after fish after hefty fish into his boat; so much so that he almost capsized. But in the end, he rowed back to shore, and thought that he should set up his home here.\n\nHe built a fire, cooked one of the fish, and took a bite out of it.\n\nIt was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted.\n\nSeveral months passed, and the prince was able to live a happy life. Many travellers who passed by enjoyed his fish and paid a high price for it. So much so, that he eventually started up a trading company specializing in the fish. Then people wanted to be employed, so he had to build houses for them too. The prince''s company soon turned into a town, into a city, and he had almost supreme authority.\n\nOne day, however, the aforementioned loan-shark arrived at the new palace. He was shown the way to the prince (who was basically now king but didn''t realize it), and said "Now that you''re king, you can pay me all that money you owed! Remember, of course that the rate was normally 8% per month, but since you''re a king, it''s 8% per day!"\n\nThe prince, realizing what had happened, fell to his knees and cried:\n\n"Is this the reel life?

"Certainly," the Chinese man said, "but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man." "OK," said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn''t keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man''s warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn''t hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, "Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest." "Well, that''s pretty crappy," he thought. "If that''s the best the old man can do then I don''t have much to worry about." He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read "Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle." In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$So this average guy in an average town was at his average job on an average day. Let''s call him Average Joe. Joe for short. \n\nJoe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. \n\nAbout 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.\n\nAbout 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. \n\nIt wasn''t 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating "Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas." He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, "Go to the nearest casino," over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, "Cash in all your money for chips." This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it''s doing. \n\nHis chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, "Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino." Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, "Put all your money on Red 6." Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, "Loser! It landed on Black 13."\nJoe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,".....Fuck."$$, ''5qm3vf'', 3, $$Gambling problem...$$);

Wanker!"\n \nThe manager is naturally a little put off by the man''s abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition.

What was that called?"\n"That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called ''Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter''s Eye, And Now The Cunt''s Blind.'' "\n"Oh" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, "err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?"\n"Fucking wanker..." interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.\n \nThe manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.\n"That little number was called ''Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.''

The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.\n \nDuring the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.\n \nAfter the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.\n"Hi" she says.\n"Oh, hello" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.\nShe leans over and whispers in his ear,\n"Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?"\nPlacing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,\n"Know it?

He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day \x201cI\x2019m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.\x201d His wife replied \x201cOkay honey, anything for you\x201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\x201cYou can know anything about me, I\x2019ll tell you\x201d the man said \x201cJust don\x2019t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.\x201d His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn\x2019t stand it anymore and asked her husband \x201cI know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What\x2019s with the two black sharks in a white pool?\x201d   \n&nbsp;  \nThe man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nDistraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. \x201cHoney, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.\x201d His wife replied \x201cOf course darling, anything for you\x201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\x201cYou can know anything about me and I\x2019ll be glad to tell you\x201d the man says \x201cWhatever you do, just don\x2019t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.\x201d His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. \x201cOkay darling. You don\x2019t have to worry.\x201d But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. \x201cDarling,\x201d she said \x201cI know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?\x201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  \n&nbsp;  \nOn their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. \x201cOh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.\x201d His wife replied \x201cAnything for you my love\x201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\x201cYou can know anything about me, nothing is secret\x201d the man said \x201cBut do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool\x201d. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. \x201cMy love\x201d she said \x201cI know you don\x2019t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?\x201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered \x201cGood evening officers, what can I help you with?\x201d  \n&nbsp;  \n\x201cSir we have some information about you and a dead body\x201d one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. \x201cWhat\x2019ve you been digging here?\x201d says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  \n&nbsp;  \nIn the police station they interrogate the man. \x201cWhy do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?\x201d The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he\x2019d accidentally killed. \x201cI loved each one of them\x201d says the millionaire \x201cBut even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.\x201d  \n&nbsp;  \nConfused, the police officer interrogating the man asks \x201cWhat is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.\x201d The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  \n&nbsp;  \nTo this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.  \n&nbsp;  \nEdit: a word and a requested TL;DR\n$$, ''5qhu8g'', 9, $$Two Black Sharks in a White Pool$$);

The professor realizes that the plumber gets paid much more than he does. Having watched the plumber fixing the pipes, he thought it didn''t look to difficult and that becoming a plumber might earn more money than being a professor.\n\n"I''m sorry to bother you, but is your employer hiring?" Asked the professor.\n\n"Yes, they are," replied the plumber, "but there is one thing you must know before you apply."\n\n"And what might that be?"\n\n"They don''t like educated people very much, so if you want to get the job you will need to lie and say you only have a 6th grade education."\n\nThe professor followed his advice, and got a job as a plumber. He quit his job at the University. Everything went well for him, and he had worked as a plumber for 6 months when the company decided that all their plumbers should have at least a 7th grade education. They were enrolled in night classes.\n\nOn the first day, everything went well. Being an educated person, the professor already knew all the curriculum, but he made sure to put in a wrong answer here and there so nobody would find out.\n\nOn the second day, everything went smoothly as well, until the instructor asked the professor for the formula for the area of a circle. As he walked to the front of the room, his mind went totally blank. He could not remember the formula, no matter how hard he tried. \n\nHe frantically wrote equations and formulas on the blackboard, trying to find the formula he needed. He found something after several minutes of frantic scribbling, but alas, it was incorrect. He felt defeated, knowing his secret would be revealed and he hadn''t even gotten the question right.\n\nThe plumbers quietly talked among themselves. The professor thought about what insults they might be coming up with, and what would happen to him now that they knew he was educated. They talked for a minute, before, apparently at a conclusion, one plumber stood up.

He runs to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and starts just sprinting over the 2nd mountain twice as tall as the first mountain. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man chasing behind the entire way. So now the man runs over the first mountain. Opens the gate, runs through, closes it. Little green man still going stride for stride. So he gets in the paddle boat and furiously rows across the 2nd river twice as large as the first river. Gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it. The little green man swimming right along after him. So the guy paddles across the first river gets to the gate, opens it, runs through, closes it and then he jumps in his car and starts driving. The little green man all along the way is very visible in the mans rear view mirror. The man starts to panic so he drives to the airport. He runs up to the front desk and says "give me a ticket to the furthest place possible!" The lady at the front desk says well that would be New Zealand. So she gives him a ticket and he boards and the plane takes off. All the time the man is in the plane he can see a tiny tiny green dot on the ground. After 16 hours the plane finally lands and the man steps off. At this point the little green man comes limping up to him. He is tired, hurt, and exhausted. The man thinks OK I''m out of options I should finally give this little green man a chance to explain himself. So the man stands there while the little green man limps up to him, touches his leg and yells "TAG YOUR''E IT!"$$, ''53ixch'', 4, $$Little Green Man$$);

The pilot would not let them pack all of their trophies, as it would cause the plane to be overloaded.\nThe administrators indicated that they must have the trophies as they were administrators and no one would believe their stories unless they had proof of their adventures. \nThey agreed, after giving the pilot an extra $6,000, that they would leave their gear and take out only the trophies. The pilot would return later for the gear that was being left at the lake.\nThe pilot was still concerned about the weight in the plane and taxied to the far end of the lake and gunned the motor. They rocketed across the lake but the plane was not becoming airborne as they approached the trees. The plane came off of the water and then slammed into the trees. \nAfter a few minutes one of the administrators crawled out of the plane and made his way to a large rock on which he stood to evaluate their situation. A voice came from the plane \x201chow far did we make it?\x201d.\n\nThe first administrator answered, \x201cAbout a hundred yards further than last year.\x201d$$, ''53hg6x'', 2, $$University Administrators.$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$This is an old one, so apologies if its been here before (I haven''t seen it yet, but I don''t check /r/jokes every day). I''m a bit bored at the moment, so I''ve embellished it a bit! enjoy :)\n\nSo, this guy is hiking in the Himalayas, as you do, and, as he''s hiking up the narrow, rock-strewn paths, he realises that it is getting late, and darkness comes early in the mountains, and he was still some distance from the next town. He starts walking more quickly, but it became dark and he couldn''t see much in front of him. Just as the panic was setting in, he rounded a corner and lo, there was a light in the darkness. A monastery, not on any map, appearing, just as it was sorely needed.\nThe guy thankfully stumbles up to the great door and bangs on it loudly. After a short time, it slowly creaked open to reveal a large, almost jolly, monk with a huge smile on his face. "Come in, weary traveller'', he says. Wondering how the happy monk knew English, but not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, the traveller thankfully entered the monastery.\n"Please join us for dinner," the monk said, with that warming and happy smile. "it will be, as always, a very joyous and happy occasion".\n"Thank you so much" says the traveller, as he is shown to a room to refresh himself before the meal.\n\nAt the meal, held in the large Hall, with all of the monastery''s inhabitants together, the traveller is seated as a guest of honour, next to the Abbot himself. Small talk ensues as they partake of the feast set before them.\nAll of the monks seem very happy and friendly. Our weary traveller is confused (thinking monasteries were supposed to be quiet, dull affairs), but again, doesn''t want to ask any awkward questions, and so is happy to go along.\nAll of a sudden, one of the monks at a lower table stands up and says loudly, "24!". The other monks start chuckling, and nodding their heads in agreement. One or two even bang their cups on the table.\nAnother monk then stands up and says, "37". A bit more obvious a reaction this time - the monks chuckle more loudly, a few laughing out loud and more cup-on-table banging. Even the Abbot chuckles to himself.\nA third monk, "65!". Loud laughter, patting on backs, more cup on table bangings, even a few feet stompings - clearly the monks are having a  good time!\nThe traveller, however, is as confused as all hell! Just as he was about to ask the Abbot what was going on, the Abbot himself stood up and shouted "17!". More laughter, more appreciation, clapping and table banging. The monks were loving it!\nThe Abbot sat down, and saw the confused look on the traveller''s face. "My son'', he said. "We love a good laugh, here at the monastery. We tell jokes at dinner time, and we all enjoy each others'' company. In fact, we tell the jokes so often, that we ended up just numbering them - it makes it so much easier to just say the number of the joke. Why don''t you try it?"\n\nThe traveller thinks for a bit and then stands up and shouts out "45". More laughter, more feet stomping, nods of appreciation, comments of ''our guest is joining our traditions" and that sort of thing.\nThe traveller is quite pleased with the response, and thinks to himself, "I''ll have another go!"\nSo he stands up and shouts out "112!!".\nThere was a moment of shocked silence, and then a deafening roar as every monk there laughed loudly, banging on the tables, stomping their feet, patting each other on the back, pointing to our traveller in obvious appreciation. Some even wiped tears of laughter from their eyes.\nThe traveller sat down again next to the Abbot, feeling quite proud of himself and turned to the Abbot saying, "They liked that one, did they?"\n"Oh yes," said the Abbot, "That was a good one - they haven''t heard that one before!"$$, ''53hblm'', 17, $$Another "guy goes to a monastery" joke - an oldie but a goodie$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$... there was a village that lived on the edges of the kingdom, by a mountainside. The village was intially called "Trifville'', as a play on how worthless it was to haggle in the village market - over time, people began affectionately calling the village "Triddville'', and the villagers, "Tridds".\n\nThe town itself was very religious; there were four sectors of the village - the Christian sector, which followed the teachings of the town priest; the Islamic sector, which followed the teachings of the town imam; and the Jewish sector, which followed the teachings of the town rabbi. The former two were born in the village, and the lattermost was initially a traveler from another village who chose to stay.\n\nOne day, a giant appeared at the top of the mountain by the town, bellowing and shaking the ground with each breath. Naturally, the people panicked - until each of the religious figures claimed that the monster was a punishment from the heavens for having a poor market. The villagers were then torn amongst themselves; there was much rioting and pillaging between the three sectors, until a small boy, furious with the riots, screamed at the top of his lungs, "IF THOSE BASTARDS ALL THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE IS, LET THEM FIX IT!"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nThere was more silence.\n\nThere was prolonged silence.\n\nA slow chant rose from the villagers, "GIANT - THEY SLAY". It got faster. It got more energetic.\n\nIt got wild.\n\nEventually, the villagers raided the homes of the priest, imam, and rabbi (which were previously untouched), and threatened them to stoning if they had not solved the giant problem.\n\nWhile they had been reluctant at first, when the villagers had kidnapped all of their daughters as hostages, the priest, imam, and rabbi seemed overly enthusiastic to solve the problem immediately.  \n\nFirst, the priest made the trek up the large mountain. Being the middle-aged man he was, he took a week to climb the sizable spike. When he encountered the giant, he said, "Brother Giant, can you not spare the villagers of your incessant breathing and stomping. My young girl wakes up every night, scared, because of your actions."\n\nThe giant, without a word, kicks the priest in the testicles so hard that the priest loses his balance, and falls backward down the mountain. He is dead before he touches the base of the mountain.\n\nSecond, the imam made the hike up the large mountain. Being the somewhat seniorly man he was, he took a two weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, in Arabic, "Brother Giant, shall you spare the villagers of your ever frequent breathing and stomping. My dearest children wake up every night, scared, because of your actions."\n\nThe giant, with a puzzled look, kicks the imam in the balls so hard that the imam loses his balance, and somersaults backward down the mountain. He is dead before he can scream.\n\nLastly, the rabbi made the journey to the top of Mount Giant. At the base of the mountain, he saw the rotting bodies of the priest and the imam; their abdomens were noticably caved in. The rabbi, slightly unnerved, just muttered to himself, *"...just a test... it''s just a test..."* Being the elderly man he was, he took a three weeks to climb the colossal mound. When he encountered the giant, he said, "Brother Giant, could you please leave us?"\n\nSuprisingly enough, the Giant said, "Okee dokee," and, from then on, the village was not disturbed from the Giant any longer. The rabbi, overwhelmed by his sucess, blurted out, "My brothers - the priest and the imam, I''ve seen them at the base of this mountain, with their abdomens caved inwards. Why haven''t I recieved the same fate?"\n\nThe Giant, smiles and says, "Silly rabbi! Kicks are for Tridds!"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Note: I''m supportive of all religions.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$On a planet called Cheeriolia, the population is divided into three societal classes: Cheerios are the lower class, Applejacks are in the middle, and Fruit Loops are the wealthy elite. One cannot intermarry between classes, unfortunately, and discrimination is rampant between them. An authoritarian government keeps very close tabs on individual classes and poverty lines criss-cross through big cities. Cheerios are doomed to a certain limit of wealth, Applejacks cannot earn more than Fruit Loops, and Fruit Loops must pay even heavier taxes. Life is difficult, and each class has its own unique complaints with the way they are forced to live.\n\nA Cheerio named Joe worked at a local Wal-Mart as a cashier, a position he had held for years because his boss is a penny-pinching Applejack. One day, he was bagging groceries for a fellow Cheerio when a Fruit Loop walked through the door, frantically darting her eyes around, panting. She ran down a couple isles, found what she was looking for, and hurried to the check-out area. The Fruit Loop had jumped into the same express lane that Joe was manning. Even though the line was moving quickly, it was an especially busy day and there were quite a few people in the queue. She exclaimed,\n\n\x201cWon\x2019t this line move any faster?\x201d\n\nThe Cheerio in front of her shook his head and chuckled to himself. The Fruit Loop didn\x2019t notice. She stood with her one item tucked under her arm, glaring at the rest of the line. Five minutes later, she was at the line\x2019s head. Joe looked at her, in awe of her beauty. She was, perhaps, the most beautiful Fruit Loop he had ever seen. His mouth fell open as she said,\n\n\x201cI don\x2019t usually shop here\x2026\x201d\n\nHer pejorative comment had no effect on Joe, who still could not believe his eyes. The Fruit Loop had to snap her fingers in Joe\x2019s face for him to finally take her credit card. She paid and left, but Joe could not stop thinking about her. He resolved to find out who she was and make her fall in love with him. There was only one problem: he was a Cheerio, and she was a Fruit Loop\x2014even if she *did* love him, it was against the law for them to marry. Still, the thought of love and marriage was hopeful, and it occupied his mind for the next two years.\n\nDuring those next two years, Joe never stopped thinking about the beautiful Fruit Loop. He worked as hard as he could, bought a chin-up bar to hand in the doorway of his tiny apartment, and subscribed to a gym membership. Joe lost some weight, started running in the mornings, and let his beard grow out. One day, much to his surprise, he awoke to a brand-new, hot-pink body that smelled very sweetly of apples. He had made the jump from Cheerio to Applejack! \n\nThat morning, Joe walked through the doors of the Wal-Mart and his co-workers stared at him, with their mouths agape. He continued working as a cashier, but one day the CEO of Wal-Mart fired Joe\x2019s boss and promoted him to manager at the request of his co-workers, who knew his humble nature and diligence would help their local Wal-Mart. He doubled their pay, and even helped stock shelves when he had nothing else to do. \n\nA few months passed, and Joe still worked out after the workday ended, but he became very lonely. The beautiful Fruit Loop still was all he thought about, so he devoted even more of his time to work and committed himself to physical fitness. In his deluded aspirations, he sought to win the heart of the Fruit Loop without even knowing her name. \n\nJust as his hope was running low, the same Fruit Loop entered the Wal-Mart, again looking very rushed, and ran down the aisle frantically looking for another item. As she was running around a corner, she ran into Joe, who was carrying a stack of boxes. They collapsed onto the floor. The Fruit Loop began to shout obscenities as Joe helped her up.\n\n\x201cSorry, miss.\x201d\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\x201cNo, I\x2019m sorry. I ran into you. I should have been watching.\x201d\n\n\x201cI\x2019m Joe.\x201d\n\nHis voice quivered slightly, and he held out his hand.\n\n\x201cVanessa.\x201d\n\nJoe led Vanessa to the cashiers, where he let his Cheerio employee go on break so he could check Vanessa out. He took a good look at her, and it was as if not a day had passed since he had seen her last. The only difference now was that he was a jacked-up Applejack who felt much closer to winning Vanessa\x2019s heart. She took her item and left once again. Thoughts of marrying Vanessa didn\x2019t leave his mind for three more years.\n\nIn those three years, Joe committed every waking moment to physical fitness. He was promoted at work and given authority over all the Wal-Marts in the tri-state area. Joe was still kind to his employees and gave them high salaries, but the economy was booming and he earned quite a bit of money without working very long hours. He attended some formal parties for Wal-Mart executive Fruit Loops and saw they way they lived, so luxuriously. Joe envied it. But all his wishes and hopes relied on his body and what he was made of. He did not lose hope. And one day, much to Joe\x2019s glee, he awoke to a brand-new, sugar-coated, bright blue body. He was finally a Fruit Loop!\n\nThat morning, Joe walked from his penthouse flat to the office and, like he usually did, ran up the stairs. All the cubicles were full when he entered, and everyone peered over to get a look at his new body. All the Applejacks in accounting were amazed, all the Applejacks in IT were amazed, and all the Applejacks in administration were amazed. His boss, the Fruit Loop directly under the CEO, took notice quickly and put in a good word with the CFO, who put in an even better word with the CEO. Both thought very highly of Joe and both thought he would make the perfect CEO one day. No-one knew that the CFO was sleeping with the CEO\x2019s wife, however, and when the CEO found out, he delved so deep into alcohol that the board of trustees voted to let him go and replace him with Joe. \n\nOne day, Joe was walking down the street to the office when he passed Vanessa. She had not aged one day in the last three years, and he immediately stopped to reintroduce himself. Vanessa was surprised it was Joe, because she remembered him to be a mere Applejack, but she did remember him nonetheless. He asked her out for some drinks later that night, and she agreed.\n\nLater that night, they met at a bar and got to talking. Joe discovered that Vanessa, despite her goddess-like beauty, had never been married and had only dated a couple other Fruit Loops. He was just as surprised when Vanessa said that she was interested in dating himself. Joe replied with a definite \x201cyes\x201d without hesitation. His dream had come true; now he was to only win her heart. When Joe got home that night, he put himself through the most strenuous workout he had ever done and fell asleep immediately after he had done his last deadlift. \n\nVanessa and Joe dated for eight months. Then, one day, on the terrace of his penthouse overlooking the harbor, Joe asked her to marry him. Vanessa screamed \x201cyes!\x201d\n\nOver the next eight years, Joe and Vanessa were faithful to each other. They had three healthy, beautiful children, and Joe continued working as the CEO of Wal-Mart. The company flourished and Joe was able to buy a large mansion out in the country where he hoped to raise his children. He kept the penthouse in the city in case he had to work late, but most of the time he was able to drive home and read his kids their bedtime stories. Vanessa never aged a day, and Joe loved her with all his heart. He had finally fulfilled his dream, and life was good.\n\nOne day, Joe was finished with an important meeting and decided to clock out and drive home to surprise his children. He had forgotten what time the school day ended and arrived in the early afternoon at his mansion. A sleek, black sedan was in the driveway, and Joe didn\x2019t know whose it was. He cracked open the front door slowly, and went straight to the bedroom without calling his wife\x2019s name. Joe had a terrible feeling in his stomach. He threw the door to the master bedroom wide open and saw Vanessa in bed with the old CFO. He screamed obscenities at him and threw him out of his house. Vanessa tried to explain that it meant nothing, that she still loved him, but Joe would have none of it. He packed a bag, booked a plane ticket, called the office saying that he was taking a brief leave of absence, and drove to the airport, distraught. \n\nHe boarded a plane destined for Hawai\x2019i and watched as his home grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Joe decided he would stay in Hawai\x2019i for a week to get his head straight and figure out what to do. When the plane arrived the next day, Joe found a five-star hotel right next to the beach. The view was lovely, and every morning before the sun was at its hottest, he would walk along the waves and think about his life. He was troubled, but at the same time he was proud of himself and what he had made of himself. Joe wasn\x2019t sure what to do.\n\nOne morning, he passed a young, beautiful woman walking the other way. She was a Fruit Loop, like himself, and though she was not as pretty as Vanessa, she was still breathtaking. Joe stopped, introduced himself, and offered to take her up to a favorite bar by the beach for some fruit juice. The Fruit Loop said her name was Merlot and that she, too, was on vacation. They had a few drinks and talked all afternoon; they told each other their darkest secrets and, by sunset, Joe felt like he knew Merlot better than he had ever known his wife. As the moon was rising, they kissed under the stars, and Joe took Merlot back to his hotel room.\n\nThe next day, they both walked along the water. The passed the same bar they had stopped at the day before, and a sign hung in the window: \n\n\x201cWe\x2019re closed for the Juice Festival on 3rd Street.\x201d\n\nThe couple was puzzled, so the walked hand in hand to the location the sign specified. A large, frightening bouncer-Applejack stood in the doorway, so Joe gave him a tip and he let them in. The party inside was loud and exciting. Along the far wall, rows and rows of booths surrounded a buffet line. The music playing was so catchy, however, that Merlot dragged Joe onto the dancefloor. Hours passed, and they were soon tired. Looking for a place to sit, the picked a booth. They kissed again. Joe felt like a new breakfast cereal. \n\nSmells coming from the buffet were so enticing that they had to try a little of everything. They stood in line and chatted up some of the other vacationers who were there for the food and drink. Soon, all the salty food had rendered them both very thirsty. When Joe offered to go find the line for the juice they had seen advertised, he stood between the islands of food and looked around. He didn\x2019t see any juice.

Chad hated Carter, and Carter hated Chad even more! One day, Chad was in a bar, drinking a tequila. Carter, drunk, came over to Chad and punched him as hard as a wooden plank could. Chad got angry and retaliated, kicking Carter in the face. They got into a bloody and violent bar fight. They both got arrested. They were sentenced to 8 months in jail, and a hefty fine for damages done to the bar. While in jail, Carter and Chad found that they had many similarities, and soon became best friends in jail. When they got out, they decided to start a business together. \n3 years later, Chad and Carter''s Hardware store was very successful and they were making tons of money. But, one day, they realized that one of their suppliers had stopped shipping them products! And this wasn''t even the first time that they have done this! The 2 wooden planks got very angry, and decided to go give the owner of the factory a piece of their mind. They went over to the factory, which was called, "Plank and Nail Industries." Chad thought that this name was a bit creepy. They entered the factory, and saw a quite normal looking lobby, with a quite normal looking wooden plank at the counter. "Hey'', Chad said. "We would like to speak with your piece of trash manager." The clerk gave them a weird look, but picked up his phone nonetheless and called him. "Please wait 5 minutes while he comes down," he said. So they waited. The owner didn''t come. "Where is he?" Carter said. "He is a very busy man," the clerk replied. They waited half an hour. Then 2 hours. Eventually even the clerk seemed very confused. 4 hours later, an angry Chad shouted, "Where is he!?" The clerk replied "I am really not sure. Please just wait a few more minutes." Chad sighed, and then looked to Carter. "How are you feeling?" Carter smacked his lips and said,\n\n"I''m board"$$, ''53988n'', 24, $$[Long] A story of how two wooden planks became best friends$$);

The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn''t sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "We can''t tell you. You''re not a monk." Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. The monks reply, "We can''t tell you. You''re not a monk." The man says, "If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk." The monks reply, "You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk." The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. "In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception." The monks reply, "Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound." The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "The sound is beyond that door." The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, "This is the last key to the last door." The man is apprehensive to no end. His life''s wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$\n\n\n So, there''s a man crawling through the desert.\n\n He''d decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn''t get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here.\n\n He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out\n and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he''d paid attention to the sun and thought he''d figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he''d be back to the small town he''d gotten gas in last.\n\n He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon\n how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he''s afraid that he''ll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,\n he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication\n later, brings an umbrella he''d had in the back of the SUV with him to give\n him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle\n in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the\n direction he thinks is right.\n\n He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he''s really thirsty. He''s\n been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He''s reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it''s mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and\n whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.\n\n He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.\n\n By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he''s been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the\n town. But he doesn''t recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn''t remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he''s close, and that after dark he''ll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that''ll be all he needs.\n\n As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,\n he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.\n\n Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back\n up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.\n\n He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they''re full of sand. He so thirsty that he can''t even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He''d forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn''t noticed it the night before because he''d been in his car.\n\n He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn''t the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day.\n\n He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in\n his mind? He''s not sure. He''ll go a little farther, and if he still doesn''t\n find water, he''ll try drinking some of the fluid.\n\n Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do.\n\n Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking.\n\n As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you''re in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.\n\n He decides that it''s time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can''t wait\n any longer - if he passes out, he''s dead. He stops in the shade of a large\n rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly\n swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry\n and cracked throat that he doesn''t even care about the nasty taste. He takes\n another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.\n He figures that since he''s drinking it, he might as well drink enough to\n make some difference and keep himself from passing out.\n\n He''s quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,\n it kills him - if he didn''t drink it, he''d die anyway. Besides, he''s pretty\n sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.\n\n He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,\n dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.\n Sometimes he''ll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He''s careful to stay away from the movements.\n\n After a while, he begins to stagger. He''s not sure if it''s fatigue, heat\n stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going.\n\n After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He\n knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing\n donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he''s getting woozy\n enough and tired enough that he''s not sure what he remembers any more or if\n he''s hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,\n trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.\n\n He was heading for a town, wasn''t he? He thinks he was. He isn''t sure any more. He''s not even sure how long he''s been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it''s been too long since he started out.\n\n He walks through the sand.\n\n After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn''t\n remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he\n doesn''t think he remembers any. This is bad.\n\n But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures\n that he''ll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from\n there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.\n\n Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third\n time, and falls to his knees. He doesn''t feel like getting back up - he''ll\n just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.\n\n While crawling, if his throat weren''t so dry, he''d laugh. He''s finally\n gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through\n the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert\n in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any\n rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -\n shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they''d be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts.\n\n He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he''s at the top,\n he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees\n is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he\n sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more\n dunes, more sand. This isn''t where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough.\n\n Again, he doesn''t know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper\n fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the\n cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It''s a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it''s dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can''t tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from\n here. He''s going to have to go down there and look.\n\n He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.\n After a few steps, he realizes that he''s in trouble - he''s not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he''s caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.\n\n He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough\n energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When\n he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot\n in the sand it still there and he hadn''t just imagined it.\n\n So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins\n to crawl towards it. He''d get up and walk towards it, but he doesn''t seem to\n have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages\n of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn''t\n have water, he''ll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last\n chance.\n\n He gets closer and closer, but still can''t see what''s in the middle of the\n dark area. His eyes won''t quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting\n his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just\n keeps crawling.\n\n Finally, he reaches the area he''d seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he''s no longer on sand - he''s now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He''s too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,\n where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone\n area.\n\n His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark\n stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun\n overhead, doesn''t seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying\n down on the nice cool surface.\n\n Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He''s\n probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and\n dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the\n beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him\n a drink. Then he''ll know he''s gone.\n\n He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he''s going to die here\n in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what''s in the\n center before he goes. He keeps crawling.\n\n It''s the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he''s\n hearing. He would swear that someone just said, "Greetings, traveler. You do\n not look well. Do you hear me?"\n\n He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and\n knees, but it''s too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something\n different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few\n seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and\n tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands\n and tries again. Better this time.\n\n Yep. He can see. He''s sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse\n of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or\n pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet\n out of the stone, at an angle.\n\n And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and\n seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long\n desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.\n\n He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn''t have the energy to get up and\n run away. He doesn''t even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his\n final resting place. No matter what happens, he''s not going to be able to\n move from this spot.\n\n Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than\n dying of thirst. He''ll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a\n little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves\n it in the snake''s direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a\n moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.\n\n Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn''t rattled yet -\nthat was a good sign. Maybe he wasn''t going to die of snake bite after all.\n\n He then remembers that he''d looked up when he''d reached the center here\n because he thought he''d heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was\n likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was\n now on cool stone. He still didn''t have anything to drink. But maybe he had\n actually heard a voice. This stone didn''t look natural. Nor did that white\n post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe\n they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake\n was even their pet, and that''s why it wasn''t biting.\n\n He tries to clear his throat to say, "Hello," but his throat is too dry. All\n that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he''s going\n to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the\n bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,\n almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn''t\n good. He doesn''t have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes\n out.\n\n He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,\n and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then\n swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk\n now.\n\n He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to\n spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, "Hello? Is there anyone here?"\n\n He hears, from his side, "Greetings. What is it that you want?"\n\n He turns his head, back towards the snake. That''s where the sound had seemed\n to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a\n speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides\n to try asking for help.\n\n "Please," he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, "I''d love to not be\n thirsty any more. I''ve been a long time without water. Can you help me?"\n\n Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was\n coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its\n mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he\n falls forward, face first on the stone, "Very well. Coming up."\n\n A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits\n up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He''s momentarily\n disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the\n sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped\n around the tilted white post, still looking at him.\n\n He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.\n He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder\n again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -\n they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been\n bitten. By the snake.\n\n "It''ll feel better in a minute." He looks up - it''s the snake talking. He\n hadn''t dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he''s not dizzy any more. And more\n importantly, he''s not thirsty any more - at all!\n\n "Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the\n afterlife?"\n\n "Sorry about that, but I had to bite you," says the snake. "That''s the way I\n work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."\n\n "You bit me to help me? Why aren''t I thirsty any more? Did you give me a\n drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be\n thirsty any more? I haven''t had a drink for over two days. Well, except for\n the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?\n Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"\n\n "No," says the snake, "I''m real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I\n didn''t give you a drink. I bit you. That''s how it works - it''s what I do. I\n bite. I don''t have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just\n sitting around here."\n\n The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the\n desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn''t, talking to a\n snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not\n great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no\n longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt\n hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool\n stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer\n dying of thirst.\n\n "I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your\n system with the next request," continued the snake. "I can guess why you\n drank it, but I''m not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left\n in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It''ll make you go blind in a day or\n two, if you drank enough of it."\n\n "Ummm, n-next request?" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting\n shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.\n\n "That''s the way it works. If you like, that is," explained the snake. "You\n get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish." The snake grinned at his\n own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.\n\n "But there are rules," the snake continued. "The first request is free. The\n second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of\n responsibility." The snake looks at the man seriously.\n\n "By the way," the snake says suddenly, "my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,\n Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound\n used to just call me ''Snake''. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn''t stand\n for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into\n names. You can call me Nate, if you wish." Again, the snake grinned. "Sorry\n if I don''t offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds\n somewhat threatening." The snake give his rattle a little shake.\n\n "Umm, my name is Jack," said the man, trying to absorb all of this. "Jack\n Samson.\n\n "Can I ask you a question?" Jack says suddenly. "What happened to the\n poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren''t I dying now? How did you do that?\n What do you mean by that''s how you work?"\n\n "That''s more than one question," grins Nate. "But I''ll still try to answer\n all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question." The snake''s grin gets\n wider. "Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need\n to drink. That''s what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not\n be thirsty any more - but ''any more'' is such a vague term. I decided to make\n it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn''t need to drink much at\n all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to\n get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.\n You''ve been changed.\n\n "For the third question," Nate continues, "you are still dying. Besides the\n effects of that methanol in your system, you''re a man - and men are mortal.\n In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.\n Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is." Nate seemed vastly\n amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.\n\n "As for the fourth question," Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack\n could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read\n talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, "first you have to agree\n to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can''t tell\n you."\n\n "Wait," joked Jack, "isn''t this where you say you could tell me, but you''d\n have to kill me?"\n\n "I thought that was implied." Nate continued to look serious.\n\n "Ummm...yeah." Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was\n talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a\n nasty temper. "So, what is this ''Bound by Secrecy'' stuff, and can you really\n stop the effects of the methanol?" Jack thought for a second. "And, what do\n you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper\n fluid, and just denature it?"\n\n "They may, I don''t really know," said Nate. "I haven''t gotten out in a\n while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and\n on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you\n pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume\n that they still color wiper fluid blue?"\n\n "Yeah, they do," said Jack.\n\n "I figured," replied Nate. "As for being bound by secrecy - with the\n fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,\n this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you\n decide to go back out to your kind. You won''t be allowed to talk about me,\n write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will\n lead someone to guess correctly about me. You''ll be bound to secrecy. Of\n course, I''ll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I''m\n guessing that you''re a man of your word, you''ll never test the binding\n anyway, so you won''t notice." Nate said the last part with utter confidence.\n\n Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a\n little nervous at this. "Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know\n that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"\n\n Well, Jack," said Nate sadly, "I can''t tell you that, unless you make the\n second request." Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.\n\n "Umm, well, ok," said Jack, "what is this about a second request? What can I\n ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"\n\n "Sure!" said Nate, brightening. "You''re allowed to ask for changes. Changes\n to yourself. They''re like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and\n before you ask, I can''t give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or\n omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous\n and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and\n sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn''t be\n omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very\n useful, at least in my opinion." Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was\n staring at him.\n\n "Well, anyway," continued Nate, "I''d probably suggest giving you permanent\n good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you''d be\n immune to most poisons and diseases, and you''d tend to live a very long\n time, barring accident, of course. And you''ll even have a tendency to\n recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a\n request to me."\n\n "Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?" said Jack. "And keep me healthy for a\n long time? Hmmm. It doesn''t sound bad at that. And it has to be a request\n about a change to me? I can''t ask to be rich, right? Because that''s not\n really a change to me?"\n\n "Right," nodded Nate.\n\n "Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?" Jack asked, hopefully.\n\n "That takes two requests, Jack."\n\n "Yeah, I figured so," said Jack. "But I could ask to be a genius? I could\n become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"\n\n "Well, I could make you very smart," admitted Nate, "but that wouldn''t\n necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you\n very athletic, but it wouldn''t necessarily make you the best athlete either.\n You''ve heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there''s some\n truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can''t make you work hard. It\n all depends on what you decide to do with it."\n\n "Hmmm," said Jack. "Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,\n after this one?"\n\n "Maybe," said Nate, "it depends on what you decide then. There are more\n rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second\n request. You know how it goes." Nate looked like he''d shrug, if he had\n shoulders.\n\n "Ok, well, since I''d rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent\n health doesn''t sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.\n Do I need to sign in blood or something?"\n\n "No," said Nate. "Just hold out your hand. Or heel." Nate grinned. "Or\n whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,\n that''s how it works - the poison, you know," Nate said apologetically.\n\n Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it\n didn''t hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better\n about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot\n snake sunk it''s fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to\n be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack\n tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it\n wouldn''t hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn''t going to be easy.\n\n "Hey, Jack," Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind\n him, "is that someone else coming up over there?"\n\n Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of\n nowhere? And did they bring food?\n\n Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...\n\n Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through\n his jeans...\n\n Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. "I would have\n decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn''t have to\n hoodwink me like that."\n\n "I''ve been doing this a long time, Jack," said Nate, confidently. "You\n humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -\n especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it''s only been a couple of\n minutes and it already doesn''t hurt any more, does it? That''s because of the\n health benefit with this one. I told you that you''d heal quickly now."\n\n "Yeah, well, still," said Jack, "it''s the principle of the thing. And nobody\n likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn''t you have gotten my calf or\n something instead?"\n\n "More meat in the typical human butt," replied Nate. "And less chance you\n accidentally kick me or move at the last second."\n\n "Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify\n to hear," answered Jack.\n\n "Ok," said Nate. "Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to\n just start talking?"\n\n "Just talk," said Jack. "I''ll sit here and try to not think about food."\n\n "We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"\n answered Nate.\n\n "Hey! You didn''t tell me you had food around here, Nate!" Jack jumped up.\n "What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically\n whip up food along with your other powers?" Jack was almost shouting with\n excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.\n\n "I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite\n it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,\n that is," replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.\n\n "Ugh," said Jack, sitting back down. "I think I''ll pass. I can last a little\n longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it\n is you find out here. And there''s nothing to burn - I''d have to eat it raw.\n No thanks. Just talk."\n\n "Ok," replied Nate, still grinning. "But I''d better hurry, before you start\n looking at me as food.\n\n Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.\n "You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."\n\n Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate\n sceptically.\n\n "Well, that''s the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack," said Nate. "Stand up\n and look at the symbol on the rock here." Nate gestured around the dark\n stone they were both sitting on with his nose.\n\n Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a\n representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around\n was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches\n left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it\n looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and\n embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.\n\n Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the\n setting sun. He wished he''d looked at it while the sun was higher in the\n sky.\n\nWait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another\n night out here! Arrrgh!\n\n Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and\n stood next to Nate. "In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate," said\n Jack. "Which way is it back to town? And how far? I''m eventually going to\n have to head back - I''m not sure I''ll be able to survive by eating raw\n desert critters for long. And even if I can, I''m not sure I''ll want to."\n\n "It''s about 30 miles that way." Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail\n this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to\n the way he''d been going when he was crawling here. "But that''s 30 miles by\n the way the crow flies. It''s about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be\n able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head\n out early tomorrow, Jack."\n\n Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and\n then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading\n out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting\n stuff. "Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"\n\n "Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway," said Nate. "He\n figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a\n ''tree'', offering ''temptations'', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he\n could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from\n across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."\n\n "Garden of Eden, hunh?" said Jack. "How long have you been here, Nate?"\n\n "No idea, really," replied Nate. "A long time. It never occurred to me to\n count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I\n do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it''s been thousands\n of years, at least."\n\n "So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?" said Jack.\n\n "Beats me," said Nate. "Maybe. I can''t remember if the first one of your\n kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it\n could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant\n requests a ''temptation'', though I''ve rarely had refusals."\n\n "Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out\n of the stone there?" asked Jack.\n\n "Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much\n bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don''t remember\n if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But\n one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do\n something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I''ve\n been here ever since.\n\n "What is this place?" said Jack. "And what did he ask you to do?"\n\n "Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?" Nate loosened his\n coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into\n the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to\n enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned\n over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as\n Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but\n Nate was suddenly there in the way.\n\n "You can''t touch that yet, Jack," said Nate.\n\n "Why not?" asked Jack.\n\n "I haven''t explained it to you yet," replied Nate.\n\n "Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something," said Jack. "You''d push it\n that way, and it would move in the slot."\n\n "Yep, that''s what it is," replied Nate.\n\n "What does it do?" asked Jack. "End the world?"\n\n "Oh, no," said Nate. "Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it\n ''The Lever of Doom''." For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing\n voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and\n grinned.\n\n Jack was initially startled by Nate''s pronouncement, but when Nate grinned\n Jack laughed. "Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it\n really do?"\n\n "Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said," smirked Nate. "I just thought\n the voice I used was funny, didn''t you?"\n\n Nate continued to grin.\n\n "A lever to end humanity?" asked Jack. "What in the world is that for? Why\n would anyone need to end humanity?"\n\n "Well," replied Nate, "I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.\n Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really\n bad, there should be a way to end it. I''m not really sure. All I know are\n the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it''s here. I\n didn''t think to ask back when I started here."\n\n "Rules? What rules?" asked Jack.\n\n "The rules are that I can''t tell anybody about it or let them touch it\n unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human\n can be bound in that way at a time. That''s it." explained Nate.\n\n Jack looked somewhat shocked. "You mean that I could pull the lever now?\n You''d let me end humanity?"\n\n "Yep," replied Nate, "if you want to." Nate looked at Jack carefully. "Do\n you want to, Jack?"\n\n "Umm, no." said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. "Why in\n the world would anyone want to end humanity? It''d take a psychotic to want\n that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,\n wouldn''t it?"\n\n "Yep," replied Nate, "being as he''d be human too."\n\n "Has anyone ever seriously considered it?" asked Nate. "Any of those bound\n to secrecy, that is?"\n\n "Well, of course, I think they''ve all seriously considered it at one time or\n another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and\n think, or so I''m told. Samuel considered it several times. He''d often get\n disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.\n But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn''t be here." Nate grinned some more.\n\n Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at\n the same time. After a bit, he said, "So this makes me the Judge of\n humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"\n\n "That seems to be it," agreed Nate.\n\n "What kind of criteria do I use to decide?" said Jack. "How do I make this\n decision? Am I supposed to decide if they''re good? Or too many of them are\n bad? Or that they''re going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"\n\n "Nope," replied Nate. "You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It''s\n up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you''re just supposed\n to know."\n\n "But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel\n horrible? Couldn''t I make a mistake? How do I know that I won''t screw up?"\n protested Jack.\n\n Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. "You don''t. You just have to\n try your best, Jack."\n\n Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly\n getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.\n\n Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. "Nate, was Samuel the\n one bound to this before me?"\n\n "Yep," replied Nate. "He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to\n read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried\n in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months\n ago."\n\n**(CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)**$$, ''52ty71'', 7, $$A Snake in the Sand$$);

I had left the campsite about an hour earlier and a terrible storm rolled in. The sky opened up and the ground was quickly saturated. I tried to continue my hike for another few minutes, but it got cold and I was chilled and soaked to the bone, so I decided to try to head back to camp.\n\n\nLightning was starting to crackle above me, so I thought I should try to take a shortcut to make my hike back quicker. I pulled out my compass and found my direction, but the rain made it impossible to see more than five feet in front of me.\n\n\nI was looking down at my compass, not paying any attention to where I was going, and suddenly felt weightless. The feeling didn''t last long as I thumped down on slippery earth a second later.\n\n\nI had fallen onto a ledge on the side of a rather steep cliff, the bottom of which was at least fifty feet down.\n\n\nI sat there, contemplating on how to get back up this cliff as water rolled over the edge ten feet above me. There was nothing to grab onto to pull myself up. I was stuck there.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, I noticed the little ledge I was standing on was slowly getting smaller. The water was coming down so hard it was eroding the tiny bit of safety I had.\n\n\nI dug through my pockets, thinking maybe I had something, anything, to help me out of my precarious situation. All I had was my compass, a cough drop, and a match. I was screwed.\n\n\nSo, I sat there, watching the edge of the ledge I was on get closer and closer to my feet, when suddenly I felt something pushing on my back.\nI turned slightly and saw a wooden box sticking out of the cliff behind me. It was working its way out of the side, the rain surely helping it along. I tried to move away from it, but the ledge wasn''t very wide and the box kept coming out, pushing me farther to the weak and failing edge.\n\n\nAs more of the box came out, to my horror, I realized it was a coffin! I had no idea how old it was, but it looked rather rotten. All I could think of was being pushed off this ledge, and the rotten coffin breaking and dropping a skeleton onto my broken and battered body at the bottom.\n\n\nThe coffin crept closer, my foot began to slip.

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$To get to the other side is the most common answer, however this answer leaves a great deal of room for interpretation. As noted historian and sociologist Ian Ormwell stated, "A joke cannot be taken at face value; all jests are subjective in their appearance and impact." Contrasting this view, the philosopher Ben Hoovian posited, "All things being equal, a joke must remain in its proper context. A joke with no context is not a joke." The issue was finally settled by post-modernist Irma J. King, who unequivocally stated, "It is the nature of humans to analyze, and all literature created should be subject to analysis." (For a more complete treatment on the subject I strongly recommend reading her seminal book "6000 Years of Humor and Counting: Humor''s influence on Human Civilization.'')\n\nAs for the original chicken joke, the most common interpretation would be to take the joke at face value: we are dealing with a "real" chicken and road. The humor of the joke is based on its simplicity: while most jokes rely on the extraordinary, the humor of this joke is based on the ordinary.\n\nOf course, one does not need to take the joke at face value. The chicken and the road can be viewed metaphorically. What if the chicken is a metaphorical coward, and is a human rather than an avian. The humor is then based not on the randomness of chicken desires, but becomes an example of cowardice and retreat.\nEven deeper, the road could be a metaphor for a dividing line, perhaps "the other side" is some kind of forbidden knowledge, perhaps even death. The simplicity of the joke reinforces the listener''s ignorance; the joke raises more questions than answers. Sadly, we may never know. Obviously, more research is needed as to WHY the chicken crossed the road. But what kind of road is it? What kind of chicken is it? And if "the other side" is indeed death, what are the implications for our own existence?\n\nPlease review my sources for their veracity.

I don''t mean to be rude there, but..."*\n\nThe man smiles. *"No, not at all. I get this all the time...*\n\n...Well, it started with the Gulf War. I was a young kid fresh out of high school, but I was poor. I needed money for college, and the Army looked like a good way out of the ghetto. But then they shipped me over to Kuwait. My platoon took some heavy fire during Desert Storm, and I was separated from them.\n\nI wandered the desert for days, with only the contents of my pack to sustain me. Sand. Sand was all I could think about. Everything else ceased to exist out there. I can only progress slowly, because I have to hide in my tent every time when even the smallest sandstorm comes around. I kept thinking, may be there are not just oases, nomads, and pompous cities in this desert. Supposedly there are ancient ruins as well. But until now now I only found lonely pillars scattered around the desert. Still my hopes were not disappointed, for now. I found a group of nomads, who were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. I decided to spend some time with them, before I set out again. Things went well, but I had nightmares on most nights. All the wandering in the desert must have exhausted me so much. I dreamt of large desert scorpion made of sand, some times it would be a large eagle chasing me into a big labyrinth.\n\nDuring one such sleepless night, I saw a mysterious man. Exhausted and wounded, was seeking refuge in our camp. Just before dying, he told me about a river whose waters bestow immortality on whoever drinks from it. The river is next to a place called the City of the Immortals. Determined to find it, I thanked my nomad friends and set out to find this City. \n\nThe days were uneventful, but the nights began to terrify me. I know that the majority of deserts are rife with life. But it is frightening to hear the sand move in the silence of night. And sometimes I found footprints in the morning near my tent, and they were definitively human. Maybe someone is just following, maybe one of the kids of one of my nomadic friends. But they grew in number the closer I got to the city, and they are always fresh. And I also suddenly heard quiet whispering one night, only heard when I almost fell asleep. I woke up from the nightmare to find myself tied up in a small recess on the side of a mountain inhabited by Troglodytes. I don''t know how I got there, but I managed to free myself and I could see the City of the Immortals in the distance. I assumed I can walk towards it, but one Troglodyte was already following me. I had to run as fast as I could to get away from him. At last I reached the City of the Immortals.\n\nThe City of the Immortals is an immense labyrinth with dead-end passages, inverted stairways, and many chaotic architectural structures. I was Horrified and repulsed by the city, but decided to get inside, because the Troglodyte was chasing me. I eventually escaped the city only to find the Troglodyte waiting on the other side. I was exhausted. I didn''t want to run anymore. I surrendered myself to him. To his will. But it turned out that he really was a Genie, and that the Troglodytes are the Immortals, having destroyed the original City of the Immortals and replaced it with the labyrinthine.\n\n''I am the Genie of the labyrinth'' said the entity. ''For finding your way out of the labyrinth, I shall grant you three wishes. What is your first wish?''\n\nI was incredulous, of course. I deduced I must be hallucinating after all this running and exhaustion, and that this was desert madness. I decided to test the mirage. ''Alright,'' I tasked it, ''I wish for a wallet with a million dollars in it, that I can never lose, and whenever I take any money out of it the sum is immediately replenished.''\n\n''Your wish is granted!'' said the Genie. I felt a bulge in one of my uniform pockets. Reaching in, I pulled out a new wallet, stuffed to bursting with crisp, new bills. I counted them -- sure enough, it was a million dollars. I ripped up the bills, cast them to the winds, and threw the wallet as hard as I could. The moment it was beyond my sight, it teleported instantaneously back to my pocket, refilled with another million dollars.\n\n''What is you second wish?''\n\nI pondered the notion for a long moment, assessing my needs. ''Genie,'' I said, ''for my second wish, I want to be transported to a cool, abandoned palace, into a harem room with a hundred beautiful young virgins who will all fall madly in love with me at first sight, before a buffet table set with a feast fit for a Persian king.''\n\n''Your wish is granted!'' Poof! I found myself in a royal harem, escaped from the heat of the desert. All around me, nubile girls eyed me with keen interest. In front of me, every conceivable type of meat was roasted to perfect tenderness, set with all the appetizers, side-dishes, salads, soups, and desserts of the four corners of the globe.\n\nI dined until I was near-bloated, and then I had a lot of sex. I mean a lot. Several hours later, laying upon a bed of feathers, brown and blonde and red haired beauties nuzzling into me like puppies at their mother''s underbelly, the Genie stood before me, looking down in satisfaction at his work so far.\n\n''What is your third wish?''\n\nI thought long and hard. Truly, this last wish tasked the very limits of my imagination, my beliefs, my ethics, my philosophy. Hours passed in silence, save for the gentle snoring of the ladies surrounding me.\n\nAt last, I spoke. ''Genie, for my third wish, I want a big Blue head.''

Dead as a doornail, the poor man.\n\n"Oh no!" said my friend, "What now?"\n\n"I don''t know, I guess we''ll have to tell his wife about his death."\n\n"Well, I know for sure that I wouldn''t be able to handle her sobbing." says my friend.\n\nI''ve always considered myself a pretty smooth talker, so I figured it would be best if I told her the terrible news.\n\n"Okay, I''ll go to their house, then. I''ll be back in half an hour." I responded.\n\n\nFifteen minutes later I walked back into the apartment with a 24-pack of beer.\n\nMy friend asks with a confused look on his face: "Where''d you get that? I knew you weren''t able to tell her. You''re just as fainthearted as I am. You should have told her that her husband died!"\n\n"Oh no, I told her." I responded\n\n"Really? How did you tell her?" my friend asked curiously.\n\n"So, I went to her house," I said, "rang the doorbell, the woman opened a window and asked: ''Who''s there?'' So i asked her: ''Good afternoon, are you widow Johnson?'' She responded: ''Well, my name is indeed Johnson, but I''m not a widow.'' So I told her: ''Want to make a bet for a 24-pack?"\n\n\n$$, ''52mapf'', 6, $$So me and my friend got a summer job...$$);

INSERT INTO reddit_jokes (body, jid, score, title) VALUES ($$There were two young boys in a pet shop. One named Derek, and his older brother Patrick. They had been given money by their father to buy themselves two animals\x2014one for each of them. There was such a selection! Dogs, cats, caterpillars, giraffes, parrots, and more. They could only afford two of the smaller animals, and so they were browsing the section dedicated to these.\n\nFirst they looked at the birds. There were parrots. The boys had heard that they could speak, but when they tried to converse with them, the parrots neglected to do so in a way that satisfied the boys.\n\n\x201cHello, Mr Parrot. How are you doing on this fine afternoon?\x201d asked Derek, enthusiastic about the chance to see such a wonderful creature in action.\n\nThe parrot looked at him, and to Derek''s disappointment, the parrot said \x201cFuck off, I''m trying to sleep you dickhead!\x201d\n\nThey moved on to the next creature which was the hamster. They watched them running around and fornicating, and as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nNext was a turtle. Both of the brothers were impressed with the sight of the turtle.\n\n\x201cThere is little chance of it running away!\x201d exclaimed Patrick, \x201cwe will never lose them!\x201d\n\nThe turtle was reading a book, and they were curious to know what it was that the turtle was into.\n\n\x201cI hope it''s the Bible!\x201d said Derek, excitedly.\n\nBut as they looked at it closer they came to know that it was Harry Potter and as they were close with the Lord, they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so foul.\n\nBeside the cage that the turtle was kept in could be found a chicken. But as they were close with the Lord they knew that they could not associate themselves with something so fowl. \n\nThey searched and searched through the shop and there was nothing that wasn''t recklessly rubbing the Lord''s face in their own sexual deviance, engagement with the Occult, or being a chicken\x2014the greatest of all sins, committed by several of the pet shop''s creatures, including the giraffe. They lamented this fact, for the giraffe appears such an innocent and sweet character! With its whiskers and tail. But alas! As the giraffe is also gravely guilty of \x201cbeing a chicken,\x201d in the Lord''s eyes he is heathen and will perish the wrath of Satan.\n\nThey sought out an employee so that they might be freed of their woes. The employee was in the process of cleaning with a broom.\n\nThey said to the woman, \x201cCan you help us?\x201d\n\nShe turned to them and replied, \x201cFuck off, I''m trying to sweep you dickhead.\x201d\n\nThen she saw the sadness and pain in their eyes and the love of God touched her heart and she had a change of mind.\n\nShe said to the boys \x201cI will help you. What is it that you need?\x201d\n\nDerek asked of her, \x201cIs there any creature in this Pet Shop that is not heathen. Is there one among the animals that does not offend the Lord?\x201d\n\nAnd understanding the boys'' woes she said to them, \x201cYes, there is one,\x201d and she led them to a small cage containing several beetles.\n\n\x201cHere you will find the weevil.\x201d\n\nAnd they marvelled at the small but innocent creature and they bought two of them and brought them home.\n\nBut their troubles were not over, for they could not tell which one should belong to whom. They decided that as Patrick was the oldest, he had a claim to the greatest of the two of them. But which was the greatest? Only a contest held between the weevils would decide the answer to this most glorious question. And so it began, the world''s smallest Olympics; with few events instead of many, with beetles instead of humans, and with only two weevils from the same family, rather than a large portion of humans from many of the nations of Earth.\n\nThey decided that before they began the contest, they would name them. One of them would be called \x201cFermented Bovine Urine\x201d and the other would be \x201cGreg\x201d for these are the names that most please the Lord.\n\nThe first contest would determine which of the beetles was superior in strength. It would be a contest of who could lift the most pianos, for the family had many pianos, and lifting pianos would be a feat of strength indeed. The creature that went first would be Greg. Greg lifted one piano and was tired after doing so. But for he was of great determination he lifted a second. And then a third. After this he apologised to the boys and said that there was no more that he could do.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine went second and it clear from the beginning that he had little capacity to lift any piano whatsoever. He was saddened by his failure and wept, for he was of inferior strength.\n\nThe next competition was to determine how each of the weevils was with navigation. So they put each in turn into a maze of the boys'' own construction. Greg, once again, was first, and he finished the maze within minutes.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine was the next contestant and he was less talented with navigation than Greg was, for he could not even make it past the first alligator-pit that had been installed. He wept once more that he was not capable of defeating Greg.\n\nThe next would determine their intelligence and so they were each given the same math problem.\n\n\x201cSurely\x201d exclaimed Fermented Bovine Urine, \x201cI can win this competition!\x201d\n\nBut whereas Greg managed to provide the correct answer, Fermented Bovine Urine had merely drawn pictures of boobies for half an hour, and numbered them so that the boys might know he can count.\n\nThe next competition would determine which of them had greater musical talent. They would both sing a song for the boys, accompanied by their mother on the piano, and the boys would know who could sing with superiority.\n\nGreg chose a piece of opera, and delivered with great competence. His voice was strong, his notes were on-pitch, his technique was at a professional level. Fermented Bovine Urine chose a punk-rock song and was disqualified.\n\nThe last and most important test was the competition to see who among the beetles was closest with the Lord. Greg stood up in front of the two boys and with no reference to the Holy Book, recited the entire Bible verbatim.\n\nFermented Bovine Urine felt the Lord in his heart, but whereas Greg was greatly dedicated to his relationship with Christ, he had spent little time on it. He instead read out select passages from Chad Kroeger''s Wikipedia page.\n\nIt was now decided. Patrick was to own Greg, the greater of the weevils, and Derek was to own Fermented Bovine Urine. The two boys took each of the creatures to their rooms and put them in their individual cages.\n\nThe next day they started to notice a difference in each of their lives which they knew was directly caused by the introduction of the weevils into their homes. Derek, the owner of Fermented Bovine Urine had gone to school that day and had found that whereas in the past people would ignore him, they began to notice him and celebrate his existence. He had become a greatly popular boy at his school. Derek praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nAs the owner of Greg, Patrick''s experience at school that day was different. Whereas in the past he had been ignored by his peers, now they would beat the living shit out of him and call him names. Patrick was enraged that his brother had been blessed and he had not, despite him owning the greater of the pets!\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, \x201cWhy, God? Why have you allowed me to suffer this way?\x201d\n\nBut the Lord was trolling Atheists on Reddit and did not hear him.\n\nThe next day Derek was given a gift by a generous neighbour which was a new bicycle. This bicycle was faster, easier to control and a far smoother ride than any he had ever experienced. He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his Glory.\n\nPatrick''s current bicycle got run over by a car whilst he was riding it and he was given several cuts and bruises and a completely broken spine.\n\nHe cried out to the Lord, \x201cWhy, God? Why have I been cursed so?\x201d\n\nBut the Lord was browsing Redtube and did not hear him.\n\nA week later Fermented Bovine Urine gave Derek a hug, and Derek was pleased for he knew that his life was filled with love and joy! He praised the Lord for his blessings and marvelled in the wonder of his glory.\n\nPatrick, though he could no longer move, asked Greg for a hug, but the beetle mistook his words and stabbed him with a used needle. He contracted aides, and cancer of the aides and was stoned to death for being a homosexual by the members of his church. \n\nIn his final moments he cried out to the Lord, \x201cWhy, God? Why have you blessed my brother so and cursed me when my weevil was greater?\x201d\n\nBut though the Lord could hear him, he was disinterested in Patrick and neglected him out of indifference.\n\nYou see, my children, there is a moral here. You must always choose the lesser of two weevils.$$, ''52l6u1'', 14, $$Two boys walk into a pet shop.$$);

Artie isn''t the brightest bulb in the world, but he''s always been there for Paul in the tough times. On October 5, 1953 Artie stood up for Paul against his bully in 7th grade.  Artie got his ass handed to him at that time, but so did Paul. That incident resulted in a life long friendship.  Paul and Artie went to the same High School together. They traveled around Europe that one summer in college. Artie was Paul''s best man at his wedding. Everyone thought speech Artie gave was terrible, But Paul loved it Artie was his best friend.\n\nArtie''s life wasn''t much better either, he never had the smarts for that great Job.  In fact he was stuck in a dead end job as a construction labourer. Artie''s car was pretty shitty too. Artie never married, but he was happy in the knowledge that at least he didn''t end up with Paul''s shitty wife.\n\nFor Paul''s 46th birthday Artie was pretty broke, so all he could get his friend was a single lottery ticket. Artie being the sentimental guy that he was picked the date of the start of their friendship, and their respective ages (46, 45).  Paul loved the present, and thought that the two of them should go to the Legion that friday to split a round of beers and listen to them call out the numbers.  \n\nOn Friday they are both sitting there at the Legion having a laugh over a couple of beers when the cute lottery girl comes on the t.v. to read out the numbers.  Paul pulls out the ticket and spreads it out on the beer stained table in front of them.  The lottery girl starts reading out the numbers, 45, 10, 05.  Both of Paul and Artie''s hearts start beating, thats 200$ already.  53, Holy crap thats like a 10, 000 ticket. They both start losing their shit. 46....... Paul feints.  He just won the jackpot. 37million dollars.  \n\nTwo minutes later Artie finally revives Paul. Paul and Artie celebrate the night away, buy round after round for the people at the Legion and get absolutely shittered. They close out the bar and as the ugly lights come on they stumble blitzed, singing, onto the street arm in arm with the winning lottery ticket in hand and start the long walk back to Paul''s place.\n\nHalfway home, Paul comes to two drunken conclusions: 1. he has to share the winnings with his friend Artie 50/50, and 2. His bitch of a wife ain''t gonna let that happen. Paul decides to share this epiphany with Artie and the two of them sit down to figure out this problem, and after about a half hour the only conclusion that they can come to is Paul''s Wife has got to go.\n\nArtie being the good friend that he is tells Paul that he is willing to take care of the little problem himself, Artie never really liked Paul''s wife anyway.  But Artie being the legal genius that he is wants to have some assurance that Paul is still gonna follow through his side of the plan and wants a contract. Paul agrees and pulls out the only piece of paper in his wallet, a one dollar bill and "Pays" Artie to off his wife.  And they come up with a plan.\n\n40 min later the 2 of them drunkenly stumble through Paul''s front door only to find Paul''s wife up in the living room. She immediatly starts yelling "WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!" "WHY ARE YOU SO DRUNK?"...... on and on she yells until finishes with "WELL IF YOU TWO ARE SUCH GOOD BUDDYS THEN YOU CAN SLEEP TOGETHER FOR ALL I CARE!" and slams the door to the bedroom.  They both look at each other, smirk, then immediately pass out on the couches.  \n\nThe next day Paul awakes to find Artie gone, Artie knows better then to be found on the couch by Paul''s wife in the morning.  Paul wakes with the biggest hangover that he has EVER experienced, but Paul knows that this day is this is the first day of a new life for him. His wife of course is in her typical mood, but Paul placates her all day with "yes, dear'', "Of course, Dear'', "I''ll get right on it Dear." All the while feeling like crap.  That evening Paul puts his plan into motion and he begs his wife to go to the Safeway to pick up some pain killers and pepto for his still lingering hangover. Because he has been soo compliant all day his wife reluctantly goes. Little does she know this is the last shopping trip she will ever make. Paul quickly texts Artie "It''s a go".\n\nWhile Paul''s wife is shopping in the Safeway Artie sneaks into the back seat of Paul''s wife''s Car and waits for her.  When paul''s wife finally gets done with the shopping and gets out to the car, Artie pops up from the hiding place and grabs her around the neck and starts choking her to death.  At one point Artie thinks to himself this is taking way longer then it does in the movies. All the while she is violently twitching and struggling in the front seat. Eventually she succumbs to the strength Artie built up over all those years of construction labour.  \n\nLittle does Artie know, but the store manager 35 year old Freddie has seen everything happen on the security cameras and has called the cops and ran outside to try to stop what Artie has done. Yet Freddie arrives just a little too late, in fact just as Artie is about to make his escape.\n\nArtie, realizing that he has been seen by this guy running towards the car knows that he has to do something to get away, so he sprints to Freddie and with one swing knocks him out. Artie then full of fear and panic gets on top of Freddie and chokes him to death as well.  Unfortunately for Artie and Paul this gives the police time to arrive and Arrest him.\n\nThe next day the paper lands on Paul''s doorstep with the headline "Artie Chokes two for a dollar at Safeway" \n$$, ''52iry4'', 21, $$Paul has a shitty life...$$);

Jack placed $30 on the bar and said, "You''re on!"  \n\nJust as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy did a swan dive off of the building, falling to his death.  The blonde was very upset and handed her $30 to Jack, saying, "Fair''s fair... Here''s your money."  Jack replied, "I can''t take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 o''clock news and knew he would jump.  \n\n"The blonde replies, "I did too;  but I didn''t think he''d do it again."\n Jack took the money...\n\n---------\n\nA blonde lady motorist was about two hours from San Diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down. \n\nThe man walked up to the car and asked, "Are you going to San Diego?"\n\n"Sure," answered the blonde, "do you need a lift?"\n\n"Not for me. I''ll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. My problem is I''ve got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be taken to the San Diego Zoo. They''re a bit stressed already so I don''t want to keep them on the road all day. Could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? I''ll give you $100 for your trouble." \n\n"I''d be happy to," said the blonde. So the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde''s car and carefully strapped into their seat belts. Off they went. \n\nFive hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of San Diego when suddenly he was horrified!! There was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd. \n\nWith a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.\n\nWhat in the world are you doing here?" he demanded. "I gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo." \n\n"Yes, I know you did," said the blonde," but we had money left over -- so now we''re going to Sea World."\n\n---------\n\nTwo blondes living in Oklahoma were sitting on a bench talking, and one blonde says to the other, ''Which do you think is farther away... Florida or the moon?''\n\nThe other blonde turns and says ''Helloooooooo, can you see Florida ???\n\n------\n\nA blonde pushes her BMW into a gas station. She tells the mechanic it died. After he works on it for a few minutes, it is idling smoothly. She says, ''What''s the story?''\n\nHe replies, ''Just crap in the carburetor''\n\nShe asks, ''How often do I have to do that?''\n\n------\n\nA police officer stops a blonde for speeding and asks her very nicely if he could see her license.\n\nShe replied in a huff, ''I wish you guys would get your act together. Just yesterday you take away my license and then today you expect me to show it to you!''\n\n------\n\nThere''s this blonde out for a walk. She comes to a river and sees another blonde on the opposite bank. ''Yoo-hoo!'' she shouts, ''How can I get to the other side?''\n\nThe second blonde looks up the river then down the river and shouts back, ''You ARE on the other side.''\n\n------\n\nA gorgeous young redhead goes into the doctor''s office and said that her body hurt wherever she touched it. ''Impossible!'' says the doctor. ''Show me.''\n\nThe redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.\n\nThe doctor said, ''You''re not really a redhead, are you?\n\n''Well, no'' she said, ''I''m actually a blonde.''\n\n''I thought so,'' the doctor said. ''Your finger is broken.''\n\n------\n\nA highway patrolman pulled alongside a speeding car on the freeway. Glancing at the car, he was astounded to see that the blonde behind the wheel was knitting!\n\nRealizing that she was oblivious to his flashing lights and siren, the trooper cranked down his window, turned on his bullhorn and yelled, ''PULL OVER!''\n\n''NO!'' the blonde yelled back, ''IT''S A SCARF!''\n\n------\n\nA Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day.\n\nThe Russian said, ''We were the first in space!''\n\nThe American said, ''We were the first on the moon!''\n\nThe Blonde said, ''So what? We''re going to be the first on the sun!''\n\nThe Russian and the American looked at each other and shook their heads. ''You can''t land on the sun, you idiot! You''ll burn up!'' said the Russian.\n\nTo which the Blonde replied, ''We''re not stupid, you know. We''re going at night!''\n\n------\n\nA blonde was playing Trivial Pursuit one night. It was her turn. She rolled the dice and she landed on Science & Nature. Her question was, ''If you are in a vacuum and someone calls your name, can you hear it?''\n\nShe thought for a time and then asked, ''Is it on or off?''\n\n------\n\nA girl was visiting her blonde friend, who had acquired two new dogs, and asked her what their names were.\n\nThe blonde responded by saying that one was named Rolex and one was named Timex.\n\nHer friend said, ''Whoever heard of someone naming dogs like that?''\n\n''HELLLOOOOOOO......,'' answered the blonde. ''They''re watch dogs!''\n$$, ''52e29s'', 2, $$Blonde Jokes$$);
